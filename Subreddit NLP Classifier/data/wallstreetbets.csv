wallstreetbets,"Hi WSB guru,

I tried asking this question in AMC sub but this is not a well received/popular topic so I thought I might get more insight from here!

From my understanding APE is a preferred equity unit for all AMC holders with par value of $0.01. It is given to current holders so it is not dilutional. 

However its value cannot be determined currently, some suggest it will start trading around 50% of AMC price more or less, but if AMC holders vote against allowing APE able to convert into AMC it will essentially be worthless? 

I hold AMC LEAP and I am worried about what would happen. From the surface this look like a forward stock split so my option price will drop 50% and I will get double my contract?

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",Anyone else holding AMC LEAP calls and what do you think will happen?,2022-08-07

wallstreetbets,"Alright, let's get into this. We've already heard this name Revlon pop up a bunch of times, but next week can truly get nutty here. Especially after seeing the poppy action right at the end of the day today, I'm convinced we get a squeeze here. Let's take a look at the reasons why:

After many high short interest names moving this week, my best stock pick to take over the weekend in anticipation of a Short squeeze is [$](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/REV)REV. Now, why $REV? Well let‚Äôs take a look at why this stock can go.

This is the market‚Äôs most shorted stock at a whopping 61% of the float being sold short here on S3 Data which costs $9000 a year and is on the Bloomberg terminal, so it's generally considered one of the best in the industry. This is confirmed by S3 Shortsight Data here:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vbekrpph98g91.png?width=1054&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=376c6383dcc48f88715e9b2d8fc99829e3f06fce

With it being the most shorted stock, it definitely has eyes on it at all times. Not only is it confirmed by S3, but also by Ortex Data, so we can guarantee that this data is as accurate as it can get since we have multiple sources confirming here.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m4fzktmi98g91.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e13adf2a9e6bfdda32ab0e9a313b1b23032b3b8

On the Ortex data we can see 71% of the float is being sold short with a 380% average cost to borrow. These are pretty large numbers.

But that‚Äôs not it‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3umdf3ij98g91.png?width=456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6549f463c5a526b7f61955221a696ef16be97282

[$](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/REV)REV was just granted a $1.4 billion loan, but the market cap is only 433 million, so this is really good news for the company.

The short squeeze thesis gets even better from here though. Fintel data has REV as number 2 on their squeeze list, up 20 spots today. It was given a squeeze score of 99.12/100, extremely high.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7vvytxqk98g91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccbf3270bbaf5046ef721598026458023c65d4d4

The options flow on REV has been insane the last two days as well. Huge institutional orders adding up to the millions have been bought. Some buyers even went as far as buying the 35C, when the stock is currently at 8, showing an expected 350% move in stock price.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pkydm0nl98g91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72232a38ce30481868f1141373271354eb282003

All this call option activity has led REV not only to become a short squeeze target here, but also a gamma squeeze target. With the #1 spot on the Fintel gamma squeeze list, it has a score of 99.57/100 at the highest spot. The Net call OI is 50% of the float. If this decides to send this can not only squeeze out shorts, but also cause a gamma squeeze here.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2tuk6kcq98g91.png?width=2526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=283fedb969090ffe859dd2db6cffc046dfb7379c

The chart has a beautiful bull flag breakout here as well. One of the best in the entire market.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k0p4rgpm98g91.png?width=1878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25c6e079766c7df04f7415a4b4d5ce4bd6647c13

To recap $REV:

1. 61% short interest on S3 Data
2. 70% short interest on Ortex Data, confirming a high % of the float is short
3. 400% cost to borrow as confirmed by Ortez
4. Granted a $1.4 billion loan on a stock with a $400 million market cap
5. Number 2 on the Fintel short squeeze list with a score of 99.12/10
6. Huge call option activity into the millions of dollars with not a single put being bought in unusual quantities.
7. Number 1 on the Fintel gamma squeeze list with a score of 99.57/100
8. Earnings next week (shorts like to cover before earnings to reduce risk)

In my opinion, there is no other better play for Monday morning other than $REV here. The theme is right and with it being the most shorted stock on the market this can go crazy.

wallstreetbets,"So many wondered why this rally happened after so much bad economic news.

While everyone has their own versions it is really hard to say one factor led to this rally.
I think the main reason is neither the short covering nor the retail or institution buying. 
Japan started buying US and Canadian bonds 3-4 weeks back when SPY was around 380 that started the fuel for rally and later short covering led to this impressive rally.
Even option market is not able to predict this move in the market as implied moves are all over the place past few weeks.
Now why would Japan start buying Bonds suddenly. Do they think bottom is in. Answer is no. They do not care about bottom or top. They are just putting their money in the safe place in case of total economy collapse. In the event of huge crash US/ Canadian economy will recover the fastest. Hence the buying of bonds.
And the thing about top/bottom of market is that absolutely no one can predict those things. They will happen without anyone knowing it.
So now what to do with the money in this market. Scalping and small gains is the key to survive these uncertain market conditions.

TLDR :- The bottom and top of market happens when no one expects them. So do not believe in imminent crash or that bottom is in.Scalping is the safest option if you are not a long term investor.",My DD about recent Rally!,2022-08-07

[https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2022/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Announces-Special-Dividend-of-AMC-Preferred-Equity-Units/default.aspx](https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2022/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Announces-Special-Dividend-of-AMC-Preferred-Equity-Units/default.aspx)

There is A LOT to unpack here, but I'm going word for word in their official documentation and will try to break it down in finer detail.

*LEAWOOD, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) (the ‚ÄúCompany,‚Äù or ‚ÄúAMC‚Äù), announced today that it has declared a special dividend of one AMC Preferred Equity unit (an ‚ÄúAMC Preferred Equity Unit‚Äù) for each share of AMC Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the ‚ÄúCommon Stock‚Äù), outstanding at the close of business on August 15, 2022. The special dividend is expected to be paid at the close of business on August 19, 2022.*

*The Company has applied to list its AMC Preferred Equity Units on the New York Stock Exchange (‚ÄúNYSE‚Äù) under the symbol ‚ÄúAPE‚Äù starting August 22, 2022 and each AMC Preferred Equity Unit is designed to have the same economic and voting rights as one share of Common Stock.*

*The AMC Preferred Equity Units can convert into Common Stock, but only if the Company proposes and investors vote to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, in an amount at least sufficient to permit the conversion of the AMC Preferred Equity Units into Common Stock (through a ‚ÄúCommon Stock Amendment‚Äù).*

*Regarding the dividend, Adam Aron, AMC Entertainment Chairman and CEO commented, ‚ÄúToday we are rewarding and recognizing our passionate and supportive shareholders, both to our shareholders in the U.S. and internationally, with a dividend of AMC Preferred Equity units that will trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol APE. Shareholders will receive one AMC Preferred Equity unit for each company issued share of AMC common stock that they own. This means that based on our 516,820,595 shares outstanding, we will be issuing a dividend of 516,820,595 AMC Preferred Equity units.‚Äù*

So this the first part telling you how it's going to happen. A new ticker will be created August 22, $APE with a total number of 516,820,595 ""units."" While it isn't common stock in the parent company (AMC), it shares the same economic and voting rights as one share of Common Stock. What does this mean? It means that if you have 1 AMC and 1 APE, you now hold 2 shares worth of voting power in corporate actions. It also means that August 22, AMC and APE are going to start off with a shared a market cap.

**EXAMPLE**

August 21, AMC closes at $22.00.

August 22, AMC opens at $11 and APE opens at $11

Same market cap, split in half between two tickers. Don't take my word for it though, Adam Aron went on a FUD cleaning spree earlier. Let's see what he says: [https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1555946487384866817](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1555946487384866817)

You're being given 1 APE share for 1 AMC share and then the stock price of AMC drops in half the following day. In other words, a stock split via 2 tickers. Remember APE and AMC both have the same economic and voting power in corporate actions. It's not really a dilution if you redefine it right? Thanks for that lesson J-Pow and co...

I can already hear the screeches... ""BuT tHeY'Re OnLy GiVeN To ShArEhOlDeRs."" Bless your heart, let me take you down a side track real quick. DRS over in that sub is relatively hit and miss. While there is no official count, as is the case in GME when they include DRS numbers in quarterly reports, let's say 25% is directly registered with the remainder being held in broker accounts. Got some bad news for you, if only 25% is directly registered, that leaves 75% registered in ""street name"" whether they are bought or not. The name of the DTC Nominee is CeDe and Co. So while they're technically correct, and only given to shareholders, the full number is still distributed. All 514,000,00 of them. Don't take my word for it here either tho.

Whatever you choose to call it, there is the first dilution since your AMC shares start at half price on August 22. Here's the kicker, you as the shareholders will have to approve the amendment to dilute next year in order to redeem your 1 APE for 1 AMC.

*The AMC Preferred Equity Units can convert into Common Stock, but only if the Company proposes and investors vote to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, in an amount at least sufficient to permit the conversion of the AMC Preferred Equity Units into Common Stock (through a ‚ÄúCommon Stock Amendment‚Äù).*

*If the Common Stock Amendment is adopted by shareholders, each AMC Preferred Equity Unit will convert into one share of Common Stock and such Common Stock will be distributed upon conversion to holders of AMC Preferred Equity Units on a one-to-one basis (one share of Common Stock for each AMC Preferred Equity Unit held).*

There is your second dilution. If the majority of APE is still in CeDe and Co, there is enough voting power to approve the dilution next year. Invest in what you want, but DRS your shit. This is my last attempt at bringing data to the ultra smooth.

2. A and B have high volumes and large market capitals (so that they cannot be easily controlled by some specific hedge funds or institutions).
3. while their prices are very correlated, A is more volatile than B in almost all time intervals. In other words, A has a higher beta than B (or equivalently, when they are increasing, A increases more; but when they are decreasing, A also decreases more).

Is there a delta-neutral stock trading strategy to profit from these assumptions? Note that here first, I am asking for a **stock** trading strategy. I do know some strategies in options. Second, I want it to be delta-neutral, meaning that I do not need to predict the moving direction of A and B. Otherwise, one can simply buy A and short sell B when he/she expects they will be up and short sell A and buy B when he/she expects they will be down. But the problem is that it is very difficult to predict the moving direction of them, especially in a short term.

wallstreetbets,"Hello!

First I started trading when RKT was popular here, I put all my student money (500$) into it at 25$ (It's 10$ now but I will only sell when it goes to 30$). Then I paused trading and last winter bought Wish and Alibaba shares but lost money selling them after a couple of months (Lost about -40%). 

So now I want to come back to trading but I think day trading or long term trading is not for me because I haven't gotten lucky yet on it. I saw that many people are buying Options on BBBY now. AFAIK Options are stock predictions (effectively borrowing the stock, selling at the predicted price and making profit on the difference). 

The main problem is that there are no tutorials for trading options - at least not for the Interactive Brokers client I am using. Well, there are tutorials - but all of them expect to have experience in trading - I don't have time to learn all those complicated sayings and words - also I'm not English so technical words are not that easy to learn for me. Why aren't there any simple 3 minute YouTube tutorials on Option trading?

So I'm using Interactive Brokers to trade and I got in to the option menu and noticed that the trading platform literally gives you info on the percentage of winning/losing money? Like it says I have 23% chance to Win 100% return and 0% chance to lose 376% of the money. Does that really mean I am guaranteed to not lose money? I can just buy this Option for BBBY and see at first?

What do you think of this thing?

Thank you!

Elon is no saint himself. He has pumped and dumped Cryptos, Fired workers that had to stay at home due to Covid and manipulating Tesla stock price by Tweeting about taking it private that led SEC to crack down on him and anything he says on public forums. 

And he becoming richest man is not a feat of his smartness either. Dude was born to rich parents. Made some acquisitions, and sold those to acquire new companies and made a killing. And yes, if you don't know, he didn't found Tesla, he purchased it.

**Workhorse Group Inc. (WKHS)** can be found in a similar setup to the **Volkswagen (VWAGY)** Short Squeeze of ‚Äò08.

For those of you who don‚Äôt know, **Volkswagen (VWAGY)** had one of the largest, most costly, and unforeseeable short squeezes in history. From a starting price of **‚Ç¨210.85 ($249.83)** to **‚Ç¨1005 ($1,190.69)**in less than two days, briefly making it the most valuable company in the world...

Now let‚Äôs try to enhance this perspective, in 2008 we were in the midst of what was known as *The Great Recession.* The worst financial disaster since *The Great Depression.* The World Equity Markets were in a progressively worsening situation across 2008. For example, two of the largest single day percentage drops in the **S&amp;P 500 INDEX** were in 2008. **1)** *10/15/08*: -9.04% **2)** *12/01/08:* \-8.93%.

In 2008 the auto industry as a whole was in a rough state because it is a *Cyclical Stock,* so it moves depending on economic confidence. So, when the state of the economy is ‚Äúgood‚Äù it goes up, when the state of the economy is ‚Äúbad‚Äù it generally goes down. Of course, in a financial crisis people are not buying cars because they have to be conservative with their money and put food on the table knowing there is so much uncertainty within the economy. With this consistent drop of the auto industry, it turned big auto companies in the world that are on every stock exchange into sexy, attractive short candidates. With that being said, of course **Volkswagen** was one of those candidates.¬†

**Volkswagen** at the time, was in some pretty serious debt, but consistently reported quarterly growth. With consistent earnings in a troubling time, **Volkswagen** managed to keep the stock price around **‚Ç¨300 ($355).**

*Ten years ago, amidst the worst financial crises since the Great Depression, the American auto industry almost died. By Fall 2008, the ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù US car companies of General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford faced potential insolvency, and without swift government intervention, their futures were in doubt.* \- **Business Insider**

**General Motors (GM)** was the biggest automaker in the world for about 72 years which they then had to file for bankruptcy on June 1, 2009. This is just perspective as to how bad the auto industry was in 2008, now I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs just as bad in 2021 but let me put the pieces together as to why this relates to **Workhorse.**

The downfall of the auto industry seemed like a no-brainer to short sellers to make boatloads of cash from struggling companies that were on the verge of bankruptcy. It was looked at as an ‚Äúeasy win‚Äù, ‚Äúeasy money.‚Äù ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs profit off of it, let‚Äôs short these companies!‚Äù¬†

Like I said earlier the auto industry was getting wrecked, so you can only imagine how luxury car companies are doing in this financial crisis as well. **Porsche** was fighting bankruptcy, just like every other car company was in 2008. Who the hell is buying a Porsche in a recession? Prior to 2008, **Porsche** was already a shareholder in **Volkswagen,** and as 2008 progressed, **Porsche** cleverly increased their holdings in **Volkswagen. Porsche** had increased their position to **30%,** then **44%** in *October 2008.***Porsche** was holding **44%** in shareholder equity, but they also held Options for an additional **30%,**which gives a total of **74%** of **Volkswagen** shares. Very clever move‚Ä¶

It was estimated that the *short interest* in Volkswagen was only **12.80%.** In today‚Äôs market that doesn‚Äôt seem too noteworthy (Workhorse‚Äôs *Short Interest*: **39%**). Now, since **Porsche** owned practically 75% of **Volkswagen** share equity, it went from the market assuming that there is an available *Float* of **45%** to all of a sudden realizing there is a *Float* of not even **%1** of outstanding shares.¬†

*With more than 70% of Volkswagen stock controlled by Porsche, short sellers realized there was nothing available to cover bearish bets. There was no stock float. All, or most, of Volkswagen shares were accounted for. The door shorts had to run through to exit their positions turned out to be microscopic.* ***-¬† Baaron‚Äôs***

When there is such little *Float* available on the market, when people are expecting there to be so much MORE *Float* then there initially is, it creates a Supply and Demand issue. And that‚Äôs exactly what **Porsche**knew was going to happen, a Supply and Demand issue. All of the short sellers needed to immediately ‚ÄòBuy to Close‚Äô their positions in **Volkswagen.** Millions of shares worth of **Volkswagen** needed to be purchased but there were just not enough shares to be issued out and sold. When there is a ton of demand, very little supply, the price of the supply inflates like crazy. And that inevitably became the **Volkswagen** Short Squeeze of ‚Äò08.

Over the span of this historical short squeeze the price of **Volkswagen** ended up breaking **‚Ç¨1005 ($1,190.69).** In the midst of the greatest financial crisis in the last 50 years, **Volkswagen** (very briefly) became the most valuable company in the entire world. That is the potential of a well engineered short squeeze‚Ä¶¬†

**Porsche**, the Hedge Fund that also makes cars, made 30 billion dollars in a few *short* weeks. (Pun intended)¬†

Now, how does this relate to **Workhorse**?

Let me put this in perspective‚Ä¶

**Volkwagen‚Äôs Short Interest:** *12.80%*

**Workhorse‚Äôs Short Interest:** *30%*

**Workhorse‚Äôs Float:** *145 Million*

**Workhorse‚Äôs Outstanding Shares:** *163 Million*

The *Short Interest* for Workhorse is 3x greater than **Volkwagen‚Äôs** Short Interest was in 2008, the main message here is to **OWN THE FLOAT!!!**

**IF WE OWN THE FLOAT, WE CAN SQUEEZE THIS LEMON!!!**

**Catalysts:**

\- Production Starting in Q2 of 2022.

\- Possible Consideration for USPS Contract (will be announced Monday at 7:00pm \[night before WKHS' earnings..\]).

\- FAA Approval (have a patent for vehicle launched drone, this could be applicable to a wide market).

\- Military Connections - most of the executives are ex-military personnel which gives them an advantage over other companies in regards to possible partnerships. 

\- Green Power Partnership (increased revenue). 

\- Chassis Production to help with supply chain issues and making domestic products. 

\- Government endorsement by representatives (Steve Chabot, Warren Davidson, etc.)

LET‚ÄôS SQUEEZE THIS LEMON!!! THIS HORSE WILL SOON GALLOP!!!

wallstreetbets,[removed],What's gonna happen on Monday?,2022-08-07
wallstreetbets,"&amp;#x200B;

1. Dividend issued in August
2. $AMC commons on the balance sheet still show 516 million shares authorized and 516 million shares issued and outstanding. But now, there are 50 million Preferred shares\*^(1) authorized and 5.16 million shares issued and outstanding also on the balance sheet.
3. $APE coin initially trades at an 40-45% value of whatever $AMC was trading at the day before the split.
   1. example: $AMC = $20, then $APE = $8.50
4. $AMC's price falls and $APE increases in price with respect to each other. So if $APE = $8.50 then $AMC = $11.50 (which totals back to the $20)
5. There are some initial troubles with all shareholders receiving the dividend, but eventually, everyone receives what they are owed and therefore the pseudo ""share count"" reveals there aren't 29 billion synthetic AMC shares as the mouth breathers believe.
6. A few weeks go by and $AMC and $APE are now arbitrage plays until the vote for the preferred share conversion takes place.
7. The share conversion vote passes because every $APE has the same voting rights as $AMC commons and $AMC mouth breathers don't understand the negative implication of actually voting yes. Now $AMC and $APE will trade almost 1:1 in price due to the ability of conversion, although a very small arbitrage will still be available to profit off of.
8. A few more weeks go by and Adam Aaron announces a dilution of $APE by the means of an at-the-market issuance of $APE of around 100,000,000 shares (which is 10,000,000 Preferred shares added to their issued and outstanding) and raises $1 billion dollars (assuming a price of $10 per share).
9. $AMC mouth breathers celebrate in the masses thinking fat cat Adam Aaron's pounce plan was a success and issuing $APE raised the company money out of thin air. 
10. A few weeks go by and some $AMC mouth breathers actually start understanding what just happened and how their stock was diluted through a backdoor $AMC opened in 2013 by voting yes on the authorization of Preferred shares. 
11. Adam Aaron tries to issue 100,000,000 $APE again and this time shareholders vote no because they realize their bags are so heavy they might start generating their own gravitational force.
12. A year or two later, $AMC runs out of means to raise capital as their attendance is still 50% of 2019 levels and their shareholder base has completely lost faith in management, so they restructure or go bankrupt. 

*\***^(1)**: they purposely made the conversion of $APE to $AMC a confusing 2-step process so they can avoid scrutiny from shareholders who don't look into it or would never understand it in the first place.*

*1 $APE does not = 1 $AMC. In reality, 1 $APE = 1/100 (one one-hundredth) of a Preferred share and 1 Preferred share = 100 $AMC. Therefore, 7 $Ape = 7/100 of a Preferred which = 7 $AMC (7/100\*100 = 7)*

*and $AMC currently has the ability to issue 5 billion $APE shares (50 million Preferred shares) because they've already authorized them.* 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a really sneaky and honestly quite evil play by Adam Aaron. He is assuming his shareholder base is a collective of blind people hopped up on Memestock Dew who are holding his hand waiting to cross the street once the light turns green. And from what I can see on social media, he is right. Too bad once they start crossing, they will all get hit by a semi-truck because the light was red the whole time.

The A.D.D. of some of the people in the sub is almost impossible to believe.

Who the fuck is celebrating in all of these posts???? and when I mean ""celebrating"" I don't mean ""today's gains"" (congratulations on those)... I mean the ""I told you so"", ""look at us now"", ""how dare you doubt our stock"" tones of the posts.

There is no way in fuck, that you are going to tell me that you all have been in since **A:.** The mere fact that you were willing to buy AMC in the first place implies you didn't even know what the stock market was back then... So fuck you if you try to claim that.

If you jumped in around **B:** or **C:** and you are now claiming victory today, after you saw **D:** and even **F:**.... then you are a fucking moron... and I really hope that's not you posting this celebratory shit.

**D: E: F: G:**???? - Seriously, just shut the fuck up.  
..... and buy mutual funds instead

Are you trying to tell me that all of you JUST got into this shit at **H:** ??????? ALL of you just became aware of AMC at **H:** ????? Because that is the only justification for ""we're smart"", ""I told you so"", ""look at us now""...   
And if so, do you fucking muppets realize that EVERYONE else you are posting this shit to, has lived through **""A - H""**?????????????????????????? (I find it hard to believe that you are all truly that dumb.)

Some of you sound like a Japanese citizen celebrating winning a wrongful death case against the US after Hiroshima.

applies to hedge funds and private equities.

We have general partners and limited partners.

limited partners provide the funding and general partners invest the limited partners money. When the general partners go to take profits, they give the limited partners their money back and they keep 20% of the profits and the 80% goes back to limited partners.

The issue arises when the general partners only have to pay long term capital gains tax (\~20%) when they're not the one's investing their money. People want these guys to be taxed at regular income tax.

wallstreetbets,"BBBY is moving and we have a larger than average volume on the daily chart. The stock is also near some long-term supports on the monthly chart.

The most recent Q2 results saw a near $500m drop in revenues on the year in the period to the end May 2022. The problem for Bed Bath is that operating expenses were the same so the company saw an operating loss of -$339M compared to $-71 a year earlier. 

Looking at gross margins, they have also fallen to 29.8% after lows of 30.35% in May 2021. Investors should hope that this a bottom and margins can recover. One potential boost could come later in Q3 or Q4 in the form of post-travel buying. Retail sales in countries such as the UK, Germany, and Australia all saw lower retail sales with higher foreign travel. Non-essential big ticket items suffered and families would've delayed those purchases to save for a vacation. That could be one area where sales could find their footing again.

The two big investment opportunities in BBBY are in valuation and short interest. BBBY trades at 0.08X sales. As a quick reference LULU trades at 5.81X sales although sales are improving. However, on that metric it looks like BBBY is undervalued and due a bounce. That could come from the shorts where the percentage of float short is 41% and a rally could see a short squeeze. 

In summary, the company has a falling revenue problem, but it is valued very low. If the stock finds a bottom in sales, longs can blow out the shorts and extend any potential rally.",Where is the floor on BBBY?,2022-08-07

wallstreetbets,"I joined the sub about 2 months ago, and GME and AMC are the most discussed stocks in this sub. So, I decided to do some research on my own about these 2. I must warn you that in my calculations shown below, I didn't include the preferred dividend, because I couldn't find relative data. So, my calculations are probably inaccurate, but I hope they approximate the exact values.


GME

GME is listed on NYSE since 1996, it reached its lowest value on the 3rd of April, in 2020, having a price of $0.70 and it reached its highest value on the 27nth of January, in 2021, having a value of $86.88. Its current price is $40.02, and based on the companiesmarketcap.com, its market cap is $12.18 billions and its earnings are -$0.49 billions. Based on these, I found the following calculations;

Outstanding shares = 304,347,826
EPS = -1.61
PE ratio = -24.85


AMC

AMC is listed on NYSE since 2014, its lowest price was $1.98 on 5th of January, in 2021, and its highest price was $62.55 on 2nd of June, also in 2021. Its present price is $22.18, it has a market cap of $$11.38 billions and its earnings are -$0.66 billions, based on the site mentioned above. Based on these facts, I derived the following calculations;

Outstanding shares = 513,074,842
EPS = -1.28
PE ratio = -17.24

I know it's not very thorough research, but what do you think about my calculations?",The battle of stonks,2022-08-06
wallstreetbets,"there any fundamental reason nobody is talking about this? The float is 500k right now with almost the entirety of the shares locked up by institutions, it has 2.8 million shares short with 1000% ctb and an earnings report soon. even minimal volume this can trend the same way gamestop did in the beginning. Another redditor wrote this up, courtesy jsmith108. 



""What makes the GETY gamma squeeze situation unique

500K float is one thing. A lot of stocks have floats like that. The insane short interest  - 2 million or whatever - even that is not unheard of.

What makes this truly unique is the call option contracts coupled with the small float. Retail can spend $3,000 on 100 shares or $3,000 on six $30 call options that cause the option writing funds to buy 600 shares as soon as the contracts go ITM.

There are over 6,000 August call option contracts that are ITM according to Yahoo from strikes ranging from $2.50-$30. That alone is over 600K shares locked in hedge. That doesn't consider the volume on each strike today, the fact that the $35 strikes and likely $40 strikes are going ITM tomorrow and the open interest on the September to February options.

Gamma squeeze indeed. This is GME on steroids.""

wallstreetbets," I just finished reviewing the Lemonade inc (LMND) quarter. I am surprised that they still couldn't turn a profit from either a EBITDA or CF perspective. EBITDA $57.4 vs. $41.3 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. A PE ratio of 5.5. 

YoY positive net financing cash flow growth of +14,887.50%; +150.29%; +13.66% and +90.44% (2017-2021)

2017: 800K  
2018: 119.9M  
2019: 300.1M  
2020: 341.1M  
2021: 649.6M

The biggest problem seems to be the balance sheet. FCF was -154M. This means the business itself lost $154m in FY21. I see the revenue recovery accompanied by the earnings. For the first half of 2022, the company has lost $74.8M running this business. They need to turn it around, quickly. The net cash position is the worst it has been in the latest 5 FY: -300.8M (2021) (prior: -31M, +85.5M, 167.9M and 301.1M, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively).

However, increase in Gross Written Premium in all geographical locations versus 2021 has been noted. 

Last earning report they lost approximately 35% of stock value within 1.5 months due to the negative numbers. July 11: $19.45. Current stock price $24.45, a difference of +23.45% in less than a month. Could be the increase before the decrease, especially given the last quarter numbers. Could be an easy short position.

As we know Joe has some success rolling over his fellow democrats and it looks as though this act which has massive financial incentives for green energy, both for consumers and the companies that provide green solutions may pass into law.

The best bits.

## Households could receive $28,500 in up-front incentives to buy electric vehicles and household appliances

Using the tax incentives and rebates in the Inflation Reduction Act, a  low- or moderate-income household could choose from a variety of  incentives that add up to $28,500 to switch to efficient electric home  appliances, install rooftop solar, and buy new electric vehicles.

The Inflation Reduction Act makes the transition to an  all-electric home more affordable than ever by offering the following  incentives, which would be available beginning this year if enacted:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Purchasing electric vehicles**: The Inflation  Reduction Act offers up to $7,500 toward the purchase of a new electric  vehicle or up to $4,000 toward the purchase of a used electric vehicle.  Eligibility is capped so that these credits are not available to the  wealthiest families‚Äîthose earning more than $300,000 per year for new  vehicles or $150,000 per year for used vehicles.
* **Installing rooftop solar**: The Inflation Reduction  Act provides for 30 percent off the cost of rooftop solar, which amounts  to average savings of $7,000, according to [estimates from the Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/Build-Back-Better-Act-factsheet.pdf). The bill also offers 30 percent off the cost of home batteries for the first time.
* **Switching to electric appliances**: The Inflation Reduction Act offers homes up to $14,000 in rebates to switch over to [electric appliances](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/decarbonize-households-america-needs-incentives-electric-appliances/)‚Äîcovering  up to 50 percent of the costs for moderate-income households and 100  percent of the costs for low-income households. The total program is  capped at $4.5 billion. This includes up to:
   * $8,000 for a heat pump, which serves as an air conditioner in the summer and heater in the winter
   * $1,750 for a high-efficiency, all-electric heat pump water heater
   * $840 for an electric induction cooktop
   * $840 for a high-efficiency all-electric heat pump clothes dryer
   * Up to $9,100 for enabling improvements to the electric panel, wiring, and home insulation
* **Improving energy efficiency**: An alternative rebate  option offers to cover more than 50 percent of the cost of whole-home  energy efficiency retrofit or more than 80 percent in the case of homes  occupied by low- or moderate-income households. Households that do not  participate in either rebate program can still claim a variety of home  energy tax credits, which are improved and extended for 10 years by the  bill.
* **Making major investments in affordable housing and multifamily rental units:**  The Inflation Reduction Act‚Äôs investment incentives aren‚Äôt just for  individual homeowners; in fact, the bill provides rebates of up to  $400,000 for whole-building energy efficiency retrofits in large  multifamily apartment buildings as well as grants and loans worth $1  billion in total for improving efficiency and installing zero-emission  equipment in affordable housing units.

We aren‚Äôt seeing a short squeeze right now, it‚Äôs more likely that it‚Äôs netting (CNS) or premature settlement of FTDs before OPEX.

Short squeeze needs dropping SI and shorts that feel forced to close. Which isn‚Äôt the case since 99% of the shorts are most likely in the green.

In the past 15 years, BBBY has had a higher price than we currently do - except for 2 months. So shorts are 99% in the green and aren‚Äôt forced to close.

So if people just pile in on calls and don‚Äôt exercise or buy and hold shares, we will not force them to close and it won‚Äôt lead to a squeeze. GME squeezed for almost 1 year before we reached the January 2021 highs. We need this kind of continuity in buying, otherwise short sellers will not bother to close.

I‚Äôve played GME since November 2020. we need continuity to achieve a real squeeze that can surpass the ATH. 

For that, we need more people being interested. Hold, buy, keep the pressure up and shop at BBBY - this is a play against bankruptcy.

S**econd Quarter 2022 Highlights**

*Financial Results and Capital Activity*

* Generated total revenues of approximately $70.5 million in the quarter, representing a 44% increase from the prior year‚Äôs quarter.
* Recorded net income attributable to common stockholders of approximately $39.9 million for the quarter, or $1.42 per diluted share, and AFFO of approximately $60.1 million, or $2.14 per diluted share (including the dilutive impact of the assumed full exchange of the 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2024 (the Exchangeable Senior Notes)).
* Paid a quarterly dividend of $1.75 per common share on July 15, 2022 to stockholders of record as of June 30, 2022, representing a 25% increase over the prior year‚Äôs second quarter 2021 dividend, equal to an annualized dividend of $7.00 per share.
* Completed an underwritten public offering of common stock, including the exercise in full of the underwriters‚Äô option to purchase additional shares, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $330.9 million.
* Exchanged approximately $3.1 million principal amount of the Exchangeable Senior Notes, leaving approximately $6.5 million principal amount of Exchangeable Senior Notes outstanding as of today.

First a Disclaimer: 

I personally have no opinion on the validity of the IIPR claims, I have no idea if they are true or false, and I have no knowledge of Kings Garden at all. The earnings call or the documents submitted to the SEC and shareholders do not mention any of these details and IIPR shareholders should understand their investment. I have no sentiment regarding Kings Garden and if these claims are false I hope they are vindicated.

**My only position is that I think IIPR is currently overvalued, Management in making terrible investments with shareholder money and is not accurately representing the weakness of its portfolio.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Kings Garden Default

I would encourage anyone to read the amended lawsuit themselves but per IIPR own filing in California Court it certainly appears to be a tad more serious than then a simple Landlord/Tenant rent issue with an easy resolution as the earnings call might have you believe... **IIPR has paid millions of dollars to a tenant for construction allowance that apparently according to IIPR ""stolen"" or ""misused""**

How does this happen?? Certainly a company this good has procedures for verifying, checking, checking again, confirming, visiting the sites in question, examining documents, etc.... Especially dealing with the public money... So they were completely fooled? Looked away? Didn't want to know? Who knows. **I make no inference from this other than to repeat the facts that IIPR is stating themselves... The money is gone, tenant is not paying and is going to dispute the case.**  

This was the Executive Chairman Alan Gold comment on the matter;

  ‚ÄúThank you, Brian, and welcome, everyone. I know one of the biggest questions for today's calls has to do with Kings Garden and what happened. To recap, Kings Garden leased six properties. The total base rent of which was approximately $5.5 million for the second quarter or approximately 8% of our base rents collected for the quarter.

Of these six properties, four were operational with a ground up expansion project also at one of those properties, which we will call the 19 Street expansion. The other two properties were in development or redevelopment, Bridge Street and Inland Center Dr. On July 13th, Kings Garden defaulted on their lease obligations and on July 14th, we filed an 8-K regarding that default. Later in July, we filed a suit with the state court asking for immediate access to our properties among other demands.

**Today, Kings Garden remains in default and on August 2nd, we amended our suit making further claims regarding construction at the properties, among other things.** Okay that is what happened. And unfortunately, we will not be able to answer any questions regarding the legal proceedings. I ask for your understanding‚Äù. 

Well....I think that's just a tad bit of an understatement and clearly nobody went and pulled this document from the County Clerk to ask any questions.... Had they, it would have been a bloodbath.

I don't know if its true or not, does not really matter to my thesis that IIPR is currently overvalued. Given that case management does not occur until Jan 2023, its unlikely a quick resolution will come.

&amp;#x200B;

IIPR certainly played it cool reporting ""99%"" rent collection... Which technically is true since the Q ended June 30th.

When did IIPR become aware of the problems with its 2nd largest tenant? By their own admission early June?

&amp;#x200B;

And it goes on and it gets way worse...IIPR decision making with shareholders money..... Not good. And I would only look to Parallel/SA Parent for the next domino to potentially fall.

&amp;#x200B;

 Anyone can get the documents from the Court and I encourage that. 

And a small sell off has commenced after being up on the earnings call.. A lot of questions need to be answered here. This is just a part of why I think IIPR is overvalued.

&amp;#x200B;

it appears some are catching on from the sing in options sentiment. But this is a REIT paying a 7.3% dividend and generally doesn't see much of this kind of volatile activity.

I'm also referring to the press statement the CEO has made which can be found anywhere in the  [web](https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2022/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Announces-Special-Dividend-of-AMC-Preferred-Equity-Units/default.aspx)

I  will use rounded numbers as to not overburden anyone's brain too much.  I'll try to use short sentences and easy words. However, Management has  made this transaction complicated.

**Background:**

1. As of August 6th AMC has ca. 500m class A common shares ('Common Share') outstanding which trade under $AMC
2. An vote to increase of the authorized amount of Commons initiated by Management has failed in 2021
3. On Aug 4th 2022 the Company has filed forms 8-A and S-3 to register and issue 50m units of ***Preferred Stock*** ('***P-Shares'***)
4. On August 4th 2022 the Company has applied to list under the symbol **$APE** what they call **AMC Preferred Equity Units** ('***P-Units***')
5. On August 4th 2022 the company has declared a **special dividend** of one P-Unit for each Common Share which will be fully completed on August 22 2022

**Description of P-Shares and P-Units:**

The  table above shows the key qualities of the 3 share instruments. It is  key to note that with the issuance of the P-Shares, **the Common Shares and the P-Units only represent ca. 18.2% of the total voting rights.**

**What does this mean?**

* As of August 22nd, current holders of Common Shares will not be in control of the company anymore
   * Common Shares will represent ca. 9% voting rights
   * P-Unit ($APE) will holders represent ca. 9% of voting rights

&amp;#x200B;

* As of August 22nd current holders of Common Shares will have a vastly reduced dividend entitlement
   * Common Shares will be entitled to ca. 9% of the total dividend
   * P-Units ($AMC) will be entitled to ca. 9% of the total dividend

&amp;#x200B;

* The Management is free to issue the remaining P-Shares to any party they may choose

**Further Provisions of the filings**

* The Management (without Shareholder consent) has the right to issue further P-Shares

wallstreetbets,"I been watching WSB for a while, I did notice that there are quite a few try to beat the market by investing some heavy risky derivatives, i.e., naked call/put option. If you are a professional trader, ignore what I say. But if you are just into the market and try to gain some money, here is a right way to do it.

**For start, you should avoid any short-term action**, which by IRS, any position hold for less than a year. Not because some BS around, simply for tax advantages. Any assets hold less than a year is subject to ordinary income tax rate which in general, MUCH higher than long term capital gain. You don't want IRS to take a cut of profit for no reason, right?

**Secondly, do not timing the market.** If there is one thing I learn from the past 5 years of trading, nobody knows how market could do tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, or next week, next month, or next year. This has been proven over and over. But people just don't believe it. They created graphs, lines, chats, all kind of ""Voodoo"" try to predict a short-term market. But so far, we haven't heard anyone who become super rich by timing or predict it.

But people still doing it anyway, just like those historical numbers on roulette, you know mathematically previous results has absolutely nothing to do with current results, but we just try to connect the dots, and still enjoy it even though it is a BS.

I do it as well, it is human nature. But if you want to make money, you have against it. In 2013, Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences was awarded jointly to Eugene F. Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert J. Shiller for proven that short term market movement is not predictible in short, it is ramdon movement (actually it is Geometric Brownian motion, but we don't need that much details). Which kind of officially announced everything is BS in financial market. However, for long time prediction, it could be very accurate. That is why when you are seeking advise from any kind of finical advisor (As long as they are licensed), they will recommend you invest at least for 3 years.

Here is a list of long holing stocks I have since 2017, you can see since time elapse, the only factor to determine a stock price is it cash flow. Which is how the price of stock is valuated. The price of stock represents company future cash flow discounted to current dollar value.

https://preview.redd.it/s7a1wnc3l0g91.png?width=2702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e87a513029e1c7f8ea2ff7d9880e2a52b80117e1

So, our job is simple. When market is in panic mode, assets won‚Äôt price correctly. Companies with solid fundamentals, will trade less than what it worth. We buy in and hold until the fair value is presented. Sell only if you need money for vacation, buy a car, a house or support child for school, or the fundamental of a company has changed.

In finance, people use Discount Cash Flow  model to calculate a company future cash flow discounted to current value. The calculation is complex, and there are lots of parameter input is by human guessing. That is why you need to invest in multiple companies to increase you chance of success. Which leads to my third point: unless you have non-public information from a reliable source, such as our house of speaker Nancy Pelosi, or company‚Äôs C level executives, which then you are subject violation of insider trading; **you should never put more than 10% of your entire portfolio into one single assets.**

Yes, people paste lots of attractive screen shots by gambling solely on GME, AMC, BBYC, etc. But the thing for gambling, is that the overall expectation is not in your favor. There is always lucky winner for each draw, but most likely will not be you. Since you are not kissed by God, investing in multiple assets is your only way to make money in a constant pace, which means portfolio diversification.

But to manage a portfolio is expansive and time consuming. It feels like working on a 2nd job. You basically acting as a fund manager, reading research reports, following news, trace macro economy and all kind of data, even with all that, sometimes still got fucked by the market.

Lucky, for every demand there is a service. We can investing in mutual fund or simply ETFs to achieve similar results by paying a small portion of fees. Which is I recommended most people to do. My self for example, have 60% of positions on varieties of mutual funds or ETFs. I know my limitation, I am good at value those high-tech firm, since this is the area that I work for almost 10 years, I know the future of the industry, better than those analysts. So do this part by myself. The area that I am not so familiar with, such as traditional industries, energy, and etc, I buy funds that will covers it. Together, these assets create a Fund of Funds, which basically covers all good companies across the globe. This strategy went well so far. Average annual return for the past 5 years is around 18%.

This way has been proven that will work. by throwing everything into a Monte Carlo (commonly used in assets return prejection for a LONG period of time). My portfolio return is granteed. Althought leaglly fund manger can't promiss you anything, but for sure, long lasting funds will genertate lots of money in a long period of time.

wallstreetbets,"Well just when you think the bears are finally going to catch a break‚Ä¶ the bulls pull the biggest PSYCH of the year. Today was even more impressively frustrating as from 11am until 1145am on SPY and from 11am until noon and 2pm until 245pm on VOLSPD the bears had locked in what we call extreme momentum. This was the first extreme bear momentum I have seen in weeks. Usually once a level of extreme momentum like this is locked in it takes a big move to get that momentum to break, however, the bulls both times broke that momentum and 180‚Äôd this. 

The dips are still call buying opportunities‚Ä¶ the MM are just getting better and better at selling these red days and trapping the bears. 

So a few very interesting things to note that has changed from last night around 7pm until now‚Ä¶ 

https://preview.redd.it/ptq8o70xwzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4e4286a69147842e5d8949343ff3d95063e27bc

Last night markets had price in an 87% chance of a 50bps hike for the September meeting after this mornings employment numbers the market now is nearly 50/50 whether it‚Äôs a 50bps or 75bps hike. Was that unbelievable drop pre market the market pricing it in already? Or does that still need to be priced in? Will markets not care until CPI Wednesday? So there is this too which is interesting‚Ä¶

I took this picture last night of the expected CPI when I was making my CPI post‚Ä¶ 

https://preview.redd.it/zydhdxlxwzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30745cfa02d835c76a22ff01aa3e31c498596d33

Check out the consensus‚Ä¶ they actually today (at some point) lowered the expected CPI consensus by 0.2%. I find this very odd and suspicious to say the least that they lowered the expected CPI consensus so close to CPI. 

I have two theories on todays actions‚Ä¶ 1. The employment numbers clearly caught the MM and markets as a whole by a big surprise‚Ä¶ I mean this opening was more red then GDP confirming a recession and gave CPI a run for its money. I believe todays action (especially looking at things like IV rank) shows the MM had today already priced in as a bullish day. It would explain a lot of what happened intraday today. 2. The markets/ feds (whoever you think is in control) realized that with a huge employment number like this with an expected terrible CPI (forecast is 9.1%) markets are panicking. They are doing everything they can to keep this market from crashing into the abyss. 

Think about it whats really driving this current bear market rally? Overall after the last CPI and last FOMC markets are pretty much under the impression that the feds about to pivot in September. This is why the GDP/ recession and last CPI is being shrugged off and why you don‚Äôt hear the ‚Äúpanic‚Äù talk much anymore about the next rate hike, cpi, etc. etc. However, today was the first time the markets really said wow with numbers like this feds aren‚Äôt going to pivot and the rate hikes aren‚Äôt done yet. Markets are late to react (usually one day) to new like this and I believe we could see that reaction Monday and Tuesday. We have CPI on Wednesday and I think that‚Äôs going to be a big deal‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g2mc6ycywzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b6466782329e218a5e09fcd45571d7245ee4b7d

I am still working off the impression that we are consolidating like we did from May 27th until June 8th before the CPI dump. If this is true then Monday (Tuesday at the latest) should start a pretty impressive and aggressive sell off. 

This last week has also set up a pretty large symmetrical breakout/ down (red lines) triangle that will most likely play out Monday if not Tuesday at the latest. Key support is 410.3 (which breaks the overall 8 week long bull channel) and resistance is 413.9. 

We are still stuck right between the daily 100ema and daily 200ema and we need to pretty much wait for one of this to hard break before we can finally see if we are going to 430 or 390s. 

It is important to note that we have not put in a new high since Wednesday so we are starting a lower high trend. If we once again reject that red solid resistance line at 413.9 Monday then I would feel more confident that we are going to drop next week. 

Key levels to watch next week remain the 100ema at 407.5 and the 200ema at 417.4. Overall nothing is happening until one of those is broken. 

https://preview.redd.it/728od8hzwzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b061604c029e31bee552aafa1e8365e17f4268a

The ES futures daily chart is looking similar yet a little different. I said yesterday ‚Äúwe are here‚Äù referring to the June 27th/ 28th candles and had we not had that ridiculous bull run at open and had we crashed down EOD like was expected we would have finished nearly identical to those days. However, we put in yet another doji on the daily. 

The bulls were able to reconfirm bull channel support tho at open and still haven‚Äôt broken that 8 week long support line. 

We here too are stuck between the daily 100ema at 4085 and daily 200ema at 4184.

The symmetrical triangle in play here too shows support at 4115 (which breaks bull channel) and resistance at 4158 (key resistance for the last 3 days) for Monday. 

Futures did finally break that extreme bull momentum support line that I mentioned I suspected would happen today since SPY broke its yesterday. 

https://preview.redd.it/hye8ee40xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=141e25ae9398701552d16d5f5147c6812d46a156

Overall the weekly SPY and ES futures charts are looking very similar. I am highlighting the May 31st weekly candle here on both SPY and ES. I am looking for a similar pattern to play out next week. This week we attempted to break out of this 415/ 4162 weekly level resistance. We tested this resistance numerous times this week, however, we failed to close over this key weekly resistance every day this week. 

I am also seeing that this May 31st weekly candle is the week before June CPI. Which also plays further into line of expectations that Monday and Tuesday is going to lead to a big sell off going into CPI on Wednesday. This would now be the 5th weekly candle to attempt to and fail to break this 415/4162 level. 

We may open Monday red and just drill all week but I suspect Monday we test this level one more time. A rejection here should result in further downside. 

Key support for the now 8 week (9 week starting next week) bull channel is 409.1/ 4100. If and when that support is finally blown through I suspect a large selloff fuel by CPI. 

If you read my CPI document you know I expect blood next week. Whether we get that or not? Well that‚Äôs a different story. The bulls are still beyond in control its not funny. At every possible weak breaking point they manage to muster together some unexpected strength. 

https://preview.redd.it/4t2usgf1xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc505d116a451d151fb27186fa0cad8e5091b236

Apples daily chart is still looking hella bullish with them too refusing to give up any of this relentless bull momentum. However, like SPY yesterday Apple broke the week long extreme bull momentum support line. That‚Äôs the first strike the next strike is going to be breaking that bull bull channel support line. 

Now despite the bull strength today the daily chart is still looking like we are putting in a teepee (the opposite of a v bottom) top. With the big run up, a doji and now a lower candle I suspect this COULD be the start to the top. 

I will be watching closely Monday for this blue support line at 159.8 and the red resistance line at 164.6. Apple has been even putting in large green days or small +/- 0.5% days for the last 8 weeks (minus maybe 2 bigger red days). Overall its going to take some pretty big news to put apple in the ground (it did open down 1.6% today which was a good start‚Ä¶). 

The trend as you can see is Apple puts in a high then has about 2-3 days of small drops before it puts in a massive green day. If this trend continues we should see a small retrace before Tuesday is big green, however, if markets can break this trend and we break that key 159.8 blue bull support line we might finally fill that gap. 

https://preview.redd.it/rpesu332xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b1d4facffa650e00ac2f1d7a09089f16d12a379

There really isn‚Äôt a whole lot to be said about apples weekly besides this 8 week channel is hella impressive. This is actually Apples first 5 green weeks in a row since October 2021. It is also the most impressive bull run Apple has had since Covid recovery‚Ä¶

Weekly support is 160.8 and resistance is 172. 

https://preview.redd.it/nw96b3r2xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ef5eea1d6576506e48903ed7c5214ac9ad09634

The VIX continues to impressively unwind. This week with CPI we are either going to see the VIX finally go back to 30 or we are about to see the VIX go back to 15. 

10% challenge-

https://preview.redd.it/arz6ypi3xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef806e54362b30b7481c6470dd9d1f7c27e6923c

Overall this was actually a great week for me. I had a good time getting back to me taking these quick scalps. 

The biggest L this week came on Wednesday when I let a put run to -73% and refused to close it at -30% when it felt like it wasn‚Äôt coming back and then not closing it at -50%. I held onto this loser WAY too long (I didn‚Äôt accept how strong the bull momentum was at the time) and that turned a GREAT week into a red week. Overall I am happy with how my week went, the play I made and my win rate. Had I cut this loser it would have changed my week from red to green. I continue at times to take losses fast enough. 

Today was a good day with 3 nice scalps. My only regret was that 1dte put. I took it before the mid day reversal (when momentum was at the bear extreme) I hit about 10% profits, however, my conviction based on what I saw was so high I didn‚Äôt take profits as I suspect we would see a retest of 409‚Ä¶ as you can see how the day went that did not pan out very well for me‚Ä¶ I was unsure whether to let this ride to Monday or not. I would need a 409 breakeven Monday in order to see green. 

I weighed the risk to reward on this on whether It would be better to salvage this and use the money Monday or whether I thought we would open and drill right to 409 to make it worth holding. In the end I chose to mitigate the loss. This was another good lesson for me that no matter how strong my conviction is and no matter what im seeing and how good it looks and how strongly everyone else also sees what I see‚Ä¶ always protect profits. 

In the end I had a great week and felt like myself again this week for the first time in a while. I look forward to next week. 

Remember to always have a plan, protect profits, and never get greedy. This market is chewing up and spitting anyone out who remotely get greedy or who thinks they are smarter than the MM is. Overall, protect your profits and protect your portfolio‚Ä¶ there are better times ahead of us. 

Have a great weekend guys!

I will basically copy paste one of my other comments on another sub to try and help you ding dongs understand. Since we‚Äôre not in such a bad echo chamber here, other users can input any corrections or highlight where I‚Äôm an idiot and completely wrong, 

Staring here:


All joking aside, I‚Äôve tried to explain and will try again. I think a lot of the confusion is coming from using words like ‚Äúdispersed‚Äù, ‚Äúreceived‚Äù, ‚Äúsent‚Äù and just an over all misunderstanding of how stock splits work.

This is probably caused by some moron who wrote some DD a while ago doing a shitty job of explaining how stock splits work and instead of verifying anything for themselves apes just go ‚Äúomg this sounds so smart, must be god tier DD‚Äù.

The main thing fucking them up is the fact that it‚Äôs called a stock split ‚Äúvia dividend‚Äù

Definition for dividend:

What Is a Dividend? A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings to its shareholders and is determined by the company's board of directors. Dividends are often distributed quarterly and may be paid out as cash or in the form of reinvestment in additional stock.

Definition for stock split:

What Is a Stock Split? A stock split happens when a company increases the number of its shares to boost the stock's liquidity. Although the number of shares outstanding increases by a specific multiple, the total dollar value of all shares outstanding remains the same because a split does not fundamentally change the company's value.

So in laymen terms, a stock dividend is when the company shares its profits with investors either through a cash dividend or gives then increased equity with a stock dividend. DO NOT confuse this with a ‚Äústock split via dividend‚Äù. A stock split is simply when a company decided to split the amount of shares in a company without changing the overall value or market cap of the company.

You know gme had a stock split for several reasons. One, they did not share any profits with share holders. They have 0 profits to share to begin with. Two, they did not give anyone increased equity in the company through this dividend. Three, every share holder owns the exact same percentage of the company they did before the split. Just distributed over more shares.

So why is it called a ‚Äústock split via dividend‚Äù then?

&gt;¬ß 173. Declaration and payment of dividends. No corporation shall pay dividends except in accordance with this chapter. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the corporation‚Äôs capital stock. If the dividend is to be paid in shares of the corporation‚Äôs theretofore unissued capital stock the board of directors shall, by resolution, direct that there be designated as capital in respect of such shares an amount which is not less than the aggregate par value of par value shares being declared as a dividend and, in the case of shares without par value being declared as a dividend, such amount as shall be determined by the board of directors. **No such designation as capital shall be necessary if shares are being distributed by a corporation pursuant to a split-up or division of its stock rather than as payment of a dividend declared payable in stock of the corporation.**

&gt;8 Del. C. 1953, ¬ß ‚ÄÇ173;  56 Del. Laws, c. 50;  59 Del. Laws, c. 437, ¬ß ‚ÄÇ10;  65 Del. Laws, c. 127, ¬ß ‚ÄÇ5;

GameStop is based in Delaware. Delaware, like any other state, has specific laws governing how dividends work. What this is basically saying is you can have a cash dividend, a property dividend, or shares in the company. If you‚Äôre going to pay a share dividend, then no shares should have a value less than the par value of the other shares of that class. If they are going to be less then that would be decided by the board and they might be a different class of shares. In either case, capital has to be designated for doing so, ie, using company profits.

OR there is no need to designate ANY capital IF you just split the shares. Ergo, a stock split. That is the part I highlighted in bold.

It‚Äôs the exact same thing as a forward split. I‚Äôm not sure Delaware law allows you to call it a forward split but it works exactly like a forward split.

&gt;The most common type of stock split is a forward split, which means a company increases its share count by issuing new shares to existing investors. For example, a 3-for-1 forward split means that if you owned 10 shares of company XYZ before it split, you'd own 30 shares after the split took effect. However, the overall value of your investment wouldn't change (at least in theory). So a forward split results in more outstanding shares but a lower price for each share, with no net gain or loss in the company's overall market value.

Doesn‚Äôt that sound exactly like GameStop‚Äôs ‚Äúsplit via dividend‚Äù? That‚Äôs because it is.

So the gme filing said shares will be distributed from GameStop to shareholders. Distributed in this context just means they voted to 4x shares and every share holder will get 4x shares they currently hold. It doesn‚Äôt mean that Ryan Cohen or Matt furlong will personally go around to each of your brokers and hand out a limited quantity of shares for each registered share holder. It doesn‚Äôt mean they are ‚Äúdistributing‚Äù stock certificates to each holder. It means the distribution of company wealth or market cap changes from 78m shares to ~250m shares. The same way that you can distribute $10 over 40 quarters or 100 dimes. It‚Äôs the same amount of money with a different distribution. The board and share holders voted on that, but they‚Äôre not physically distributing shares. Each individual share doesn‚Äôt have a stock certificate. Stock certificates haven‚Äôt been used for over 20 years.

So when some brokers say ‚Äúwe‚Äôve received the shares from Dtc‚Äù (seems to be the German brokers) either it‚Äôs a mistranslation, the service rep doesn‚Äôt understand how it works, or they literally just mean ‚Äúwe‚Äôve been given the instructions by the DTC to officially perform the split.‚Äù It DOES NOT mean they received a limited basket of shares from the DTC.

On July 6, 2022, GameStop announced a 4-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend, effective as of July 21, 2022, for stockholders of record on July 18, 2022. Tax information related to this stock split can be found [here](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/1764b8e4-0e1d-41a6-b502-8c5ab7604dc8).

**GameStop Guidance for International Stockholders with Split-Related Questions** ¬†¬†

*GameStop has notified its transfer agent and the Depository Trust Company (‚ÄúDTC‚Äù) that some of our valued stockholders in international geographies are still trying to determine if they have received the proper stock dividend associated with the Company‚Äôs recent 4-for-1 stock split. Please note GameStop has already distributed the shares of common stock required for the stock dividend to its transfer agent, which has confirmed it subsequently distributed the appropriate number of shares of common stock to DTC for allocation to brokerage firms and other participants. We recommend that stockholders using a brokerage firm contact that firm with needs or questions. Stockholders may want to make their brokerage firm aware if they recently moved shares to the Company‚Äôs direct registered list, as we have been informed this move could impact a firm‚Äôs distribution of shares.* ¬†

*As always, we appreciate your investment and enthusiasm. Although we are not able to engage with individual brokerage firms, we are monitoring this situation and will keep you informed of any relevant updates we obtain through our transfer agent or DTC.*",GameStop wrote the DTC a spicy little love note re: the splividend üòò,2022-08-06

At the same time, the blocking period may shrink significantly following the price increases;  if the Pagaya stock trades for 20 consecutive trading days above the price of $12.5 (average share price in daily trading, VWAP), as of today it completes seven such trading days.‚Äù
The investors and the owners probably sitting on 300-400 millions shares that they locked from selling and the stock trades above 12.5$ for 11 days or so.

wallstreetbets,"The current situation is rough. The Fed is currently trying to calm inflation without causing a recession. This is beginning to seem less and less likely. With the labor market staying strong, GDP continuing to drop and inflation powering forward it appears as though the Fed may have to take drastic measures to calm inflation, which could cause a recession. The bond market definitely agree with this as the 6 month yield is about the same as the 30 year indicating a high chance of a recession. 

The markets didnt hear that during this rally, instead they saw corporate earnings, which weren‚Äôt as bad as expected and therefore the markets rallied significantly. However insiders of the companies that rallied are selling hard. According to Zero Hedge insiders are dumping the most stocks since January. This indicates that insiders are taking advantage of the rally created by retail investors to sell there positions at artificially inflated prices. Additionally, according to a Bloomberg article that cited BofA data, bond inflows are the highest since November while stock outflows are resuming. It certainly looks like smart money is beginning to leave equity markets. 

I believe that this rally came from better than expected corporate earnings and uncertainty being removed from the markets. And while both of these things are legitimate reasons for stocks to rise, a 13% rally is definitely over the top. With economic data such as CPI just around the corner and a less than favorable macroecomic situation I believe that stocks will return to a more reasonable valuation in the coming weeks.

[SIGA Reports Financial Results for Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2022](https://investor.siga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/siga-reports-financial-results-three-and-six-months-ended-june-0)

[SIGA Technologies Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call](https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=l67Q42FS)

**Bull Case**

Covid was a tsunami that came quick, it was a novel virus with no vaccine and hospitals had no clear idea how to treat it.

Monkeypox is not going to be like Covid. There will be no lockdowns. The economy will not crater or lock up. Instead it will be a slow burn and since we have a vaccine (JYNNEOS) and an anti-viral (TPOXX), it will be more like preparing for a famine or a drought. It's all about making sure the resources go where they need to while we wait it out.

It is not an STI but transmitted by sweat, spit and other bodily fluids. The spread will be slow and will come as cluster outbreaks in social networks. The death rate will be low. The complication rate is an issue though. Blindness, internal scarring, encephalitis. 

It affects children more than adults and the elderly might still have some immunity from getting the smallpox vaccine back the day. Daycares and elementary schools may be centers of contagion because children are disgusting little garbage monsters who put their hands and mouth on everything and are too stupid to understand basic germ theory.

Right now the gays are mostly (but not exclusively) getting it, so everybody dismisses it. The first elementary school breakout and parents are going to lose their minds.

**SIGA**

SIGA made TPOXX as an emergency anti-viral for Smallpox. This is a small company that just happens to be at the perfect place in history. Nobody else has a product like theirs. It's beautifully suited for the moment:

1. It has already been approved for general use for Monkeypox in Europe.

2. It has been approved for compassionate use in the US, and general use is likely forthcoming.

3. They have traditionally sold to the US and Canada. Price per course is $250-350 in the US and $900-$1000 for Canada.

4. The US has had a stockpile of 1.7 million courses for years, in case of a biological attack. SIGA has had an existing $600 million contract to replenish as they expire, with $300 million on that contract remaining. *The US will most likely purchase additional TPOXX over that stockpile in order to maintain their emergency reserves.*

6. They have received orders from 10 non-US countries. Nine of which are new, totaling $60 million in new international orders.

7. TPOXX is showing fantastic effectiveness but most of all, **little to not adverse effects** compared to placebo. Testimonials from patients and doctors have been glowing.

8. TPOXX is shelf stable at room temperature and has a long expiration. Countries can buy larger amounts now in anticipation instead of future spread.

9. According to the guidance call, production can ramp up to meet high demand without any foreseeable issues.

10. SIGA is looking into making TPOXX commercially available. If monkeypox goes endemic over the long term, that means it becomes the monkeypox equivalent of Valacyclovir.

11. $40m in liabilities with almost $215m in assets with $103m cash on hand. Great position to be in, financially.

12. Revenue for Q2 increased 51% over Q1 2022 and 91% over previous year's Q2 2021.

**Bear case**

1. The stock was already over 20 P/E due to speculative pumps before all the good news came in. This means you're going to have to stomach wild swings since it's possible it might already be fairly valued for forward earnings.

2. We're going to be timing the market for a virus we don't know a ton about. Monkeypox might die out before SIGA pulls in real numbers.

3. Profiteering on global pandemics could make you feel like a piece of shit and might not be morally and/or biblically defensible. I think about that. I don't think anyone reading this really cares, but I do think about it.

4. Human studies are still early and dependent on patient studies because you can't infect people with monkeypox to test a drug. Which means it's very possibly bad side effects might come up as the drug is more widely used.

**Conclusion**

Let's do the math. If 25 countries want to stockpile 500k courses of TPOXX at $300 per (very low estimate for foreign countries), that's revenue of $3.75 billion. Will they sustain that forever and ever? Most likely no. But for the time being, that's a huge spike in revenue.

I have a small position in SIGA. I originally bought as a yolo bet for fun. Since then everything coming out is nothing but positive. The company is solid. They recently did a 25 million share buyback in Q1. The science is solid. They're staying dry and technical about the future, which I always appreciate over bs hype.

After years of vaccine hesitancy, it will be hard to get people (aside from gay men) to vaccinate, but once people get weeping pustules on their eyeball, it will be *very* easy to convince them to take TPOXX.

No price target. Not investment advice. I just like the stock.",SIGA is a real one. Here's why.,2022-08-06

wallstreetbets," Canoo, under the code GOEV, has already received an order for 4,500 electric vehicles from Wall Mart and an option for another 10,000 vehicles. Both the initial and subsequent orders are valid on the condition that the company is able to set up the required production line. The estimate for the cost of this line is about $2 billion. At the same time Wall Mart has signed up to exercise options at $2.2. Wall Mart has nothing to lose, only to gain from this deal.

We're going to Canoo under the code GOEV

Before it signed with Wall Mart, it had nothing in its possession to help it implement its plans. Now it had an agreement with Wall Mart. Is it reaching? Maybe it will. But certainly if she can't build a production line with that agreement in her hands, she will reasonably never be able to. Of course, everyone has shorted the stock on the basis the company will be forced to issue new shares to get the cash it needs. It seems a very easy bet for those who have shorted.

Let me start with a few questions to provide food for thought:

1. How often has the Vast Majority fallen in on its stock market bets?
2. More than 36 million shares are already short and the average volume for the twelve months is about 4 million shares per day. I have the feeling that if the stock goes over $5 everyone will look to close positions and the door will be very narrow, and the stock will probably post high double digits in consequence. What do you believe?
3. Why would Wall Mart waste time and sign with Canoo and not sign with a company that already has a production line?
4. After the announcement of the Wall Mart deal the share price moved from $2.5 to $5 and after making a double peak at exactly $5 the stock is now at $3.7. Before the announcement of the deal the short positions in the stock were 34 million shares. After the announcement the positions jumped to 36.5 million shares. So everyone is so confident that the new shares will have a strike price below $3.5 that they will push the stock down with the announcement? If the stock is currently worth about $1 billion that has nothing in its hands but plans, will it be worth just $3 billion if it finds the $2 billion it's looking for?

wallstreetbets,"ITS NOT AN INVESTMENT ADVISE. MY PERSONAL ADVISE IS STAY AWAY FROM CASINOS IF YOU CAN üòÅ . These are very two similar cities where you see lot of incoming traffic every year. In both cities Gambling is legal. Both cities have great public transportation. Both cities got Casinos within a very close vicinity to train stations and located in central places of downtown. Both are university cities. Both cities got lot of Chinese population and so Bacarrat is most popular game over the week ends in all the Casinos. Its very hard to win over week ends in both cities. Only difference is how they operate the Casinos. Vancover operate it in Vegas style like they don't really depend on repeat customers. So if you drop-in to a Casino in Vancouver you cannot start winning without loosing 500-1000$ over a weekend depending on your wallet capacity. They will treat you like a repeat customer who comes back again only after you lose 1000$ which acts like a safety deposit or after loosing small amounts in multiple visits and then only the Casino allows you to win. So its hard to return home with a profit in Vancouver. One technic to win here is to play for less initially and wait for that lucky span of time. Now don't ask me what is the lucky span of time. Rely on your sixth sense which may work unless you are totally drunk. You take with you some 100$, play for a couple of hours and loose that amount. Buy a couple of drinks while you are playing with these 100$. Smile, laugh and act friendly and polite with the staff. Tip them when you win and show that you are just there to enjoy the ambience. Tell the staff to hold the place by claiming it as your lucky place. After loosing 100$(20$ should be for drinks and 20$ should be tips), withdraw 500$ from the atm in the casino. Count the money after you are back at your table and buy chips for 500$. Start slow again for next 10-15 bets and once you saw the time is ripe just increase your bet to 10 times your starting bet.  If you are down by 100$ in this visit thats it for the day - GO HOME. No tips or celebration on your secind visit. Play very serious and if you are dare enough use one or two very bad words when you lose looking straight at the person who won. Dont spare even its a girl as you already bought your good will for 100$ from the Casino and most importantly you are drunk. Once you have over 750$ as chips,  its the time to cash-in and walk out. Dont miss the last train home. Keep the visit to max one time in a month. If you can come home with a profit in Vancouver then you are really a A+ gambler. Melboune works the other way as it got only one Casino for the whole city. They need repeat customers who can bring other customers with them. So they will make you win first in Melbourne. Also the casino will maintain a happy hour every 12 hours or per shift. You will see top gamblers in Melbourne and as a gambler its very important to know who are there only to win. If you see people winning in games like Bacarrat, Black jack then the streak will not change for long time. If you are a Black Jack lover just wait till you find a winning spot on the table. If you are loosing and someother is winning wait till they leave and take their spot. Also wait for special days like valentines day, new years day etc for big bets where the happy hour can be a night long and you will see gamblers making 50K in an hour.  A+ gamblers can make it big in Melbourne. But the logic is you should make a frequent but not so frequent visits to Casino to win in Melbourne.  Dress well in formals and maintain good attair from Head to Toe, have costly drinks but less and make friends with staff by tipping. If you are still in positive side in-terms of Casino winnings even after 6 months in Melboune then you are a A+ gambler. Don't ever deposit your winnings back to your bank account as the Casino in Melbourne will have access to the bank accounts of the people who visit them regularly after their 5th visit in a month. #ramasrandomthoughts",Melbourne Vs Vancouver Casinos,2022-08-06

wallstreetbets,"I'm sure everyone has seen the ridiculous gains made by $HKD and $MEGL and wished they caught the wagon early; I know I did. There is obviously no fundamental reason for them to rip the way they did. I did some quick digging and quickly found out there's not much info out on these companies. 

However, there are a lot of similarities. They both:

* Very recently IPOed - MEGL was today, and HKD was 2 weeks ago or some shit 
* Have very little volume
* Are Hong Kong based
* Small number of employees
* Vast majority of shares held by insiders (No data for MEGL on this but it makes sense that insiders need to hold almost everything to trade back and forth with each other driving the price up before ultimately cashing out)
* BOTH DON'T HAVE OPTIONS AND AREN'T SHORTABLE (this is big)

Apparently back in the 90s right before the dot com crash Chinese companies would IPO for pennies and rocket to $40-50. This got me thinking so naturally I started looking for the next one.

Thats where I found $TOP

It shows all of the same exact traits as $HKD and $MEGL, importantly no options and it is not shortable. 

When you look at the chart however you might think the show is over. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, $HKD did the same thing, a spike and then pull back before ripping like it did a few days ago.

This is obviously truly retarded and a total shot in the dark, however after IPOing around the mid 20s I don't think there's too much downside potential, especially considering it could rip like we've seen the other two. There's no way to tell which Chinese P&amp;D will moon next (obviously like $MEGL it might not even be public yet), however of all listed companies I believe this has the most similarities and is most likely to rip next as it is similar in every way. (11 employees, recent IPO, Hong Kong, Insider held Obviously not financial advice. I just bought shares AH in hopes it moons next week for god knows what reason. I cannot say how truly retarded it is but on the off chance it moons it could be fun to be along for the ride.

Thesis: Musk's bot issue is not real. TWTR does not make any reps about bots in the merger agreement and their SEC filings only mention that they try to estimate the number of bots but the actual number might be greater than 5%. Specific performance will be issued and Musk will be forced to close the deal at $54.20/share.

By [Russ Mitchell](https://www.latimes.com/people/russ-mitchell) Staff Writer¬†   Aug. 5, 2022 1:03 PM PT     

The  California Department of Motor Vehicles has accused Tesla of false  advertising in its promotion of the company‚Äôs signature Autopilot and  Full Self-Driving technologies.

The agency alleges the electric  carmaker misled customers with advertising language on its website  describing Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies as more capable  than they actually are.

The company ‚Äúmade or disseminated  statements that are untrue or misleading, and not based on facts,‚Äù the  DMV said in a pair of complaints filed with the state Office of  Administrative Hearings on July 28.

The DMV complaints point to  the very names of the technologies, as well as other ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù  language such as the following, which [appears](https://www.tesla.com/en_AE/autopilot/%3Fredirect%3Dno) on the Tesla‚Äôs website Autopilot page:

‚ÄúAll  you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go. If you  don‚Äôt say anything, your car will look at your calendar and take you  there as the assumed destination. Your Tesla will figure out the optimal  route, navigating urban streets, complex intersections and freeways.‚Äù

The  remedies proposed by the DMV if it prevails could be severe, including  revocation of the company‚Äôs licenses to make or sell its cars in  California. But actual remedies would likely be much softer.

A DMV  spokesperson said Friday via email that if its action succeeds, ‚Äúthe  DMV will ask that Tesla will be required to advertise to consumers and  better educate Tesla drivers about the capabilities of its ‚ÄòAutopilot‚Äô  and ‚ÄòFull Self-Driving‚Äô features, including cautionary warnings  regarding the limitations of the features, and for other actions as  appropriate given the violations.‚Äù

In June, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk underlined the importance of Full Self-Driving to the company. Without FSD, Tesla is ‚Äú[worth basically zero](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-worth-basically-zero-without-self-driving-2022-6),‚Äù he said.

The  Full Self-Driving feature costs $12,000 and purports to automatically  pilot the car on freeways, city streets and neighborhood roads;  automatically obey traffic signals; and roam a parking lot without a  driver to park itself.

Despite the name, no car available for  purchase by individuals is capable of fully autonomous driving from  Tesla or any other company.

Tesla cars never could ‚Äúand cannot now, operate as autonomous vehicles,‚Äù the DMV claims assert.

The  DMV notes that Tesla‚Äôs website states that ‚Äúthe currently enabled  features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle  autonomous.‚Äù

But, the DMV said, the disclaimer ‚Äúcontradicts the  original untrue or misleading labels and claims, which is misleading,  and does not cure the violation.‚Äù

Tesla‚Äôs driver-assisting  technologies have been popular features that help the carmaker stand out  in an increasingly crowded electric vehicle market. But YouTube videos  showing its systems placing cars in dangerous situations have drawn  attention, including near head-on collisions with trucks and trains that  require a driver to yank the steering wheel to avoid a crash. One video  appears to show Tesla‚Äôs sensor system confusing the moon for a traffic  light stuck on yellow.

Autopilot, a less expensive feature that  combines automatic cruise control with automatic steering and automatic  lane changes, came under investigation by the National Highway and  Traffic Administration when Teslas showed a pattern of plowing into  emergency vehicles parked by the roadside.

It‚Äôs unclear how many  crashes involve Full Self-Driving technology, and if any of those  crashes have led to death or injury. Tesla‚Äôs onboard computers are  capable of communicating that information over the air to Tesla, but the  company doesn‚Äôt share that data with the public.

Recently, Musk  claimed that Full Self-Driving had not been a factor in any Tesla crash,  although at least eight crash reports submitted by Tesla owners to  federal safety regulators [indicate otherwise](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-07-14/elon-musk-said-no-self-driving-tesla-had-ever-crashed).

Tesla‚Äôs  response to the DMV complaints, if any, has not yet been made public.  Tesla has no media relations office. Musk did not respond to an  invitation to tell Tesla‚Äôs side of the story.",California DMV accuses Tesla of falsely advertising Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features,2022-08-06

Today was a nice day...75k win from some small caps and AMC...Update from my previous posts where I hit 500k, 527k and now 565k...no need to read any further if you have seen my previous post

From prev post for background

TLDR : Turned 6k into over 565k in 2 years while banging you‚Äôre wife on the side

Background on me: 36/married/1 kid/own home/cars/boat/earn mid 100s/yr

2020 :

I started this Roth account in April of 2020 with 6k with the idea of being risky and turning it into something big. If it didn‚Äôt work out, oh well as I still have other accounts. I have a brokerage, 401k, IRA as well that I don‚Äôt touch all that much (basically it‚Äôs in SPY/QQQ) and has been for a while. I have traded penny/small caps with my brokerage over the years and taken out gains to pay for stuff (home down payment, cars and ect)

Most of my experience in trading up to this point was in my brokerage where I did really well trading penny stocks/small caps during marijuana/internet money boom years

As you can tell by the chart, I didn‚Äôt make the majority of my $ during 2020 but did pretty well on Covid stocks and tried out options trading for the first time. I didn‚Äôt yolo my whole port into my plays, but I understood the power of options (huge wins/huge losses)

Top 5 gains/losses of 2020 below

2021 :

Early part of 2021, I started to get a little bit riskier and got lucky on some of the meme plays. Almost hit 100k due to RKT options in March. Then I hit a patch where I didn‚Äôt really win/lose a whole lot until late in 2021.

Fake internet money was going crazy, and I just thought it was unsustainable. I tried to find miners and etf‚Äôs that tracked it and I landed on buying puts on MARA and BITO, which was clutch as that mooned me up to 200k

[https://imgur.com/ABJOvmj](https://imgur.com/ABJOvmj)

2022 :

Holy volatility‚Ä¶in the beginning of 2022 I just played the trend of going down‚Ä¶shorted BITO again and loaded up on inverse leveraged ETFs‚Ä¶I also switched back and forth between bull/bear gang gang multiple times. Lost some on some stupid plays that I was trying to force/chase that brought me down a bit in April, but refocused on the trends and taking profits‚Ä¶nobody ever lost money taking profits

In terms of what I have been doing lately? Well, kinda what I‚Äôve tried to do all the time, which is play the trends‚Ä¶whether that is meme stocks, short squeezes, inflation downturns‚Ä¶just trying to feel the market I guess‚Ä¶your wife likes it

Played some ACM and some small caps today FTW

wallstreetbets,"üì∑ **Hello,** ConfirmationTobias. AMC Stubs #69696969696969

My fellow AMC shareholders,It's an exciting time at AMC, filled with good news for AMC¬†shareholders. As you may have heard, we reported our encouraging 2022 second quarter earnings results on August¬†4. There were some 59¬†million attendees who enjoyed a movie at an AMC theatre around the world from April through June of 2022. That's 168% more guests than in the same quarter last year. Along with their increased food and beverage spending on a per patron basis, as compared to pre‚Äëpandemic levels, they enabled AMC to return to positive Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, reflecting a sizable year‚Äëover‚Äëyear improvement!We also announced on August¬†4 a special dividend of a new AMC Preferred Equity unit being given tax‚Äëfree to shareholders of AMC's 516,820,595 issued and outstanding common shares. The issuance of this dividend is not currently dilutive, as at least for now AMC Preferred Equity units will all go, and ONLY go, to our current shareholder base as of the dividend payment date later in August. These new AMC Preferred Equity units will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, ‚ÄúAPE.‚ÄùThe issuance of AMC Preferred Equity units will clarify who is included in our shareholder base and offers AMC investors another avenue to participate in AMC's recovery and growth. Crucially, it also gives AMC a new currency to strengthen our balance sheet through debt reductions and/or capital raising should we choose to do so. This in turn materially lessens our near‚Äëterm survival risk, as we continue to work our way through this pandemic. And THAT, fundamentally strengthens our company. We can also use the currency for M&amp;A activity, as we seek new value creating investment opportunities to benefit all AMC¬†shareholders.In my opinion, the creation and issuance of AMC Preferred Equity is the single biggest step we will take in all of 2022 to deeply strengthen your company, AMC Entertainment. We believe, looking at the long term, all this is not good news for those who delight in rooting against us at¬†AMC.Be sure to check out more details around the dividend announcement by visiting our [Investor¬†Relations¬†website](http://click.email.amctheatres.com/?qs=0c329089816b3308b2b2458ef1bf28e30c2aedd6eab380f08adac9abd5a9fd3dcca82ce5c51855c2fdffe77dbaf37b40f7dc34fc2617ac5e8300845c8b6b49ac).In conjunction with these announcements, I am proud to share with you that we also will be enabling you to receive TWO free NFTs, being given to our existing AMC Investor Connect members, as well as to those who join AMC Investor Connect by August¬†31,¬†2022.To commemorate our APE dividend and as a token of our appreciation for your ongoing and continued support, you will be entitled to receive a free ‚ÄúI OWN APE‚Äù NFT. Please keep your eye out for an email during the week of September¬†19, with instructions as to how to redeem your ‚ÄúI¬†OWN¬†APE‚Äù¬†NFT.Likewise, based on the popularity of the original ‚ÄúI OWN AMC‚Äù NFT that was issued in January of 2022, that same mid-September email also will detail how you can claim free an updated version of an ‚ÄúI OWN AMC‚Äù NFT. If you redeemed the January 2022 ‚ÄúI OWN AMC‚Äù NFT, through this new issuance you can get a second but slightly different ‚ÄúI OWN AMC‚Äù NFT. If you were unable to redeem the January 2022 NFT, you can make up for that now, and still proudly proclaim your AMC ownership by redeeming the September 2022 version.Thank you again for your continued support of AMC! Stay tuned for more great offers, and l look forward to seeing you at an AMC Theatre sometime¬†soon.üì∑Adam Aron

wallstreetbets,"There are plenty of good posts outlining why you should be in $BBBY - In this one I'm simply addressing why you'll regret not going in as hard as you could today. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Point 1:** Most Hedgies and funds haven't had time for their analysts to properly model this play yet. 

What does this mean? 

First, it means that they have a lot of potential capital to allocated or deallocate from BBBY. Why deallocate? Well, they could be short and come Monday morning they may decide to shrink their short position. Smart hedgies / funds won't only start to decrease their short position, but they will FLIP. This means they'll buy double. IE: If they're short 500 shares and they want to be long 500 shares it means they have to buy 1,000 shares. Understand? 

Second, it means we will see a lot of big money firms start to make moves on BBBY next week after their analysts spend several hours this weekend trying to figure out the best way for them to profit / cut losses here. 

Result? BBBY will trade higher on Monday than it's trading today. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Point 2:** Not everyone on WSB has heard what is happening with BBBY. Not only that, but word of mouth will spread like fire over the weekend amongst friends / colleagues, frat boys, etc. They will all come ready to trade on Monday. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Point 3:** Many people get paid on Friday (today) and over the weekend when they find out about BBBY, they will proceed to throw their paycheck at it to test the waters. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Point 4:** There are some people here who are highly skeptical, when they see it touch $10 next week they will fomo into it (is it really fomo if it's still going to run though? You decide). 

&amp;#x200B;

wallstreetbets,,We all know what‚Äôs happening,2022-08-06
wallstreetbets,"***TL;DR:*** Liberty Tripadvisor (LTRPA) is a holdco owning Tripadvisor (TRIP) shares.  Think of LTRPA like leveraged version of TRIP.  Pull up todays pricing on LTRPA vs. TRIP to get a sense.  Multi-bagger potential on straight equity; no theta/etc.

If TRIP's technical-breakout sticks LTRPA is going to be a ***fun-time***.

**LTRPA notes:**

* ***Steep*** holdco discount.  LTRPA simply owns roughly $600mil of Liberty's stake in Tripadvisor but it trades at a $250m market cap.  The holdco gap narrowing to normal holdco-margins should provide a decent return in-and-of itself.  You're buying $1 for $0.50.
* It's Liberty Media.  Greg Maffei &amp; John Malone love making money.  (*We're just gonna forget the QRTEA part of Liberty mythology lmao*).  LTRPA is undoubtedly a stain of Maffei's reputation and he would *love to change that*.  He plays to win.
* TRIP may be finally breaking its brutal downtrend.  A lot of special-sits folks have sidelined LTRPA for this very reason; just letting the pain settle first and letting the market say when to ***go***.
   * Why did the downtrend break?  Tripadvisor is turning around slowly.  The new Liberty-appointed CEO is finally taking the reins and the quarter was solid.  There's enough bad-news baked into price that it's fairly asymmetric now.
* Travel looking good.  TRIP &amp; LTRPA were murdered by COVID.
* Tripadvisor is a good asset historically run by underwhelming management.
* Nice market backdrop with the bear-market providing a natural tailwind.  Tons of shops are trapped short/underweight-equity during a very oversold environment.  Recession will be a shallow-one or non-existant after Q2 GDP revisions until late-2023.

**Price Example**

The last time TRIP traded $30/share, LTRPA traded $2.50/share.  It's a little more complicated than that but you can get the idea.

**Risks to consider:**

* LTRPA is very small and illiquid.  Do not use market orders.  Anything this small &amp; illiquid can whipsaw you fast.  Please be diligent on risk-controls and size it accordingly.  For myself personally I'd size it like you'd size a call-option: 1-3% of portfolio.
* Historically Tripadvisor has been a place money goes to die.  This is a very contrarian play.
* LTRPA had a fairly big fuckup in March 2020 with a margin call that was ultimately bailed out by Certares.

Enjoy &amp; have fun on Greg Maffei's money-train.  I mostly lurk so don't expect much chatter from me; just thought this was a fairly juicy sit to share.

**Disclosure:** Long LTRPA.  Small option-sized position in my PA &amp; client accounts

I think there is a major bubble in the United States, and all across the globe for that matter, in the form of jobs that do not provide anything of tangible value and rapidly improving technology.  At a certain point these two elephants in the room are going to have to clash, and I think we are beginning to see that transition with this manufactured financial crisis.

You go to a restaurant and there's a hostess that seats you and a server brings you your food... but why?  I don't want to tip someone $10 because they brought my food to me and refilled my beverage, most of us I think would rather just pay a little less and get them ourselves.

But I don't want to just talk about low paying jobs, lets go to the next income bracket.  How about a car salesman?  Or how about the people that own the lots?  Car manufacturers could easily sell their own product without having to involve a middle man just for the sake of it, but lobbyists just wouldn't allow that.  Step it up to someone like a real estate agent, sure their services can be convenient but I'm finding it hard to believe we couldn't figure out a better way.  Maybe I'm oversimplifying this but an extra 4 - 6% to someone that took a 6 month course seems a bit off.

Even further though, let's look at the financial sector, including many of the retards on here.  Yeah that's right, you thought you were beneficial to society by clicking buy and sell?  Sure, it takes some intelligence to make the right moves, but a well trained ape can click buy and sell, you may be making money but what kind of value does that provide?  A large chunk of the US GDP essentially boils down to people counting and moving around their own or someone else's money, this makes numbers grow larger in bank accounts, but I think the 7 year old Ethiopian mining for lithium by hand contributes more to the world than most of us.  Besides, the algo-overlords have already taken control of the markets, I think the days of making money from trading could be coming to a close.  Imagine if retail traders had access to an algo-trading program and every retard could just boot it up and watch their bank accounts grow.  Does that make any sense? 

I don't think this will happen overnight, but I do believe the transition has begun.  We've all heard it before, by 2030 you'll own nothing and be happy, I think they're saying that largely because of what I've outlined here.  One day human beings will be obsolete, I don't think every job will be eliminated by 2030 but a large chunk could already be eliminated right now, they're ripping off this band-aid slowly and painfully but it's the only option.  But what the heck do I know, I'm just another fellow retard that has no F-in clue what's going on.  I just want 2030 to get here already so I can immerse myself into a sexed up virtual reality world and finally role play as a real fish.

TLDR:  Massive bubble of service oriented jobs that do not produce anything of tangible value is being slowly deflated by improving technology.  WEF 2030 agenda is right on schedule.  Crickets aren't that bad when they're coated in Cheeto dust.",So I heard you like BUBBLES,2022-08-06

wallstreetbets," Apple reportedly warned suppliers not to use 'made in Taiwan' labels on products to avoid angering China following Nancy Pelosi's visit

Apple told suppliers on Friday to avoid labeling products from Taiwan as ""made in Taiwan,"" according to a report from Nikkei.

The tech company told its suppliers that products or parts made in Taiwan must be identified as made either in ""Taiwan, China"" or ""Chinese Taipei"" to avoid indicating that the island is independent of China, the Japanese business news outlet said.

According to Nikkei, Apple made the decision in order to avoid possible supply chain disruptions from Chinese scrutiny over the labels, especially as the company prepares to receive components from Taiwan that will be used for new products slated to launch later this year.

Some iPhone components were held for review on Thursday to see whether the shipments were labeled to China's satisfaction, Nikkei reported.

Apple did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment ahead of publication.

Apple's warning comes only a few days after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi traveled to Taiwan in a visit that prompted a strong reaction from China. The nation has claimed Taiwan as its own for decades, even though China has never controlled the self-governed democratic country.

Pelosi's actions were seen by Beijing as a ""major political provocation"" and a challenge to China sovereignty, Hua Chunying, China's assistant minister of foreign affairs, said on Twitter. Chinese President Xi Jinping warned ahead of the visit that the Biden administration would get ""burned."" Beijing also launched a series of military drills around Taiwan in response.

Pelosi has been outspoken in her support of Taiwan's independence.

Other than the reasons this stock is being hyped for, like RC is in it, or it's shorted 101% or 46%, or getting a new CEO. A main aspect is often overlooked, it is FREE MARKETING!!!!

Yesterday lots of people didn't know BBBY existed or never bought from it before.

Today after it got some traction here, lots of people are mentioning in their posts that they've bought the 29$ annual subscription from BBBY and they're buying items from their shops.

Free marketing and brand awareness cost billions of dollars. Next time when you need an item sold by BBBY, you're gonna choose them over their competitors, especially that they have a bigger variety in of items in their niche.

So regardless if the short squeeze happened or not, the stock will grow organically as more people are aware of the brand.

After the pandemic-related shutdown, Royal Caribbean has slowly built back its business. The company became operating-cash-flow positive in the second quarter and has seen demand bounce back to 2019 levels.¬†

While the last 2 1/2 years were certainly challenging, we have proven that our business and company are resilient. Our business is now fully back up and running, and our operating platform is larger and stronger than it has ever been,

Buying Endeavor was an opportunistic move to quickly expand a cash-generating part of the business.¬†

Normally, building a ship involves tying up capital -- generally borrowed capital -- to pay for an asset that won't add revenue until it can begin booking sailings.

In this case, RCL got an asset that immediately begin sailing for a price lower than it would have cost to build.

RCL stock is a solid good investment.

wallstreetbets," Wall Street is feeling the most downbeat about the stock market in years, according to Bank of America analysts, and investors are getting ready for a recession.

In a Wednesday note, analysts wrote that the bank's Sell Side Indicator has plummeted to its lowest mark in over five years. The metric, which tracks the average recommended allocation of stocks by sell-side strategists, slipped 78 basis points in July.

""We have found that Wall Street's consensus equity allocation has historically been a reliable contrarian indicator,"" BofA analysts wrote. ""While the SSI does not catch every rally or decline in the stock market, the indicator has historically had some predictive capability with respect to subsequent 12-month S&amp;P 500 total returns.""

In the past, Wall Street's consensus equity allocation has been able to signal the opposite of what strategists recommend, meaning it's been a bearish indicator when analysts were bullish, and vice versa.

Now, the Sell Side Indicator has hovered in ""neutral"" territory through the first half of the year, but is now inching closer to ""Buy"" after recent declines.

wallstreetbets," Hiring surged in July, with U.S. employers creating 528,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said Friday. That far exceeded economist expectations for gains of 250,000 new jobs during the period. It was also a jump from the previous month, when businesses added 372,000 jobs despite the highest inflation in 40 years.

The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5% from 3.6% in June, marking the lowest since February 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in the U.S. Before the latest payrolls report, the economy was adding roughly 450,000 jobs per month.

Both total nonfarm employment and the jobless rate have returned to their pre-pandemic levels.

The employment numbers underscore the resilience of the economy following two straight quarters of declining GDP, which is considered a hallmark of a recession. Despite this shrinking economic growth, hiring has remained robust as businesses continue to add jobs and hold onto their current workers amid strong consumer demand.

""This is a job market that just won't quit. It's challenging the rules of economics,"" said Becky Frankiewicz, chief commercial officer of hiring company ManpowerGroup in an email after the data was released. ""The economic indicators are signaling caution, yet American employers are signaling confidence.""

US unemployment rate in July decreased to 3.5%, the lowest since February 2020. This job growth is likely to weigh on stocks because it signals that the Fed can continue raising interest rates.

The company itself does not have its own production facilities but instead  relies on third-party production sources. 
This means the company‚Äôs CAP X is very low and they can scale up production if required. 

If the monkey pox outbreak warrants the company can produce up to 500,000 courses a year with the current capacity.
In pill form, the drug is taken over a period of two weeks and this is a course. 
The price for each course for international customers Is $900-$1000 per course. 
In the US it is $300-$400. 
Pricing differs depending on the size of the order. 
Should  the company deliver 500,000 courses in a single year it‚Äôs revenue from Tecovirimat would be  $500 million in that year. 
Revenue (TTM) was 139.4 million as per last reporting, so the growth potential for the company and its share price is significant.

wallstreetbets," Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla rallied in after-hours trading Thursday as the company won shareholder approval for a 3:1 stock split, the second such move in around two years, as the world‚Äôs most valuable automaker looks to make its stock more affordable.

In a widely expected move, Tesla shareholders approved the company‚Äôs proposed 3:1 stock split, causing shares of the company to continue rallying in after-hours trading following a 0.4% gain earlier in the session.

Tesla first announced the proposed 3:1 stock split in June as a way to make the $925 stock more affordable; based on today‚Äôs closing price the new share price would be around $308.

Though the stock is down roughly 20% this year amid the wider market selloff, billionaire Elon Musk‚Äôs electric vehicle maker has still seen its shares surge more than 200% since the last stock split in August 2020.Stock splits don‚Äôt impact a company‚Äôs market value, but evidence suggests that by making shares more affordable to retail investors, the move does often provide a short-term boost to share price.

Tesla shares are up over 30% since announcing the 3:1 split in early June, while news of Tesla‚Äôs 5:1 stock split roughly two years sent shares over 70% higher in the 20 days following the announcement.

Several other major tech companies have announced stock splits this year and saw subsequent spikes in their share price; Google-parent Alphabet‚Äôs split 20:1 in February and Amazon‚Äôs stock split 20:1 split one month later.

Chimerix already entered an agreement with Emergent Biosolutions (The guys that make Narcan -- among many other drugs) to sell their Smallpox drug, Tembexa, to Emergent. But Chimerix is getting a royalty out of the deal -- of 20% of sales in the USA and 15% of sales in Europe. Emergent has to know that this drug will be approved for Monkeypox. If not, why pay $337.5 million for a smallpox drug when Smallpox has been declared eradicated for over 40 years?   


Monkeypox is clearly on the rise. We missed our window to contain it. People don't show symptoms for as long as 3 weeks. Gay men as a group have a lot of sex... based on studies a lot more sex than straight people. This disease is spread by sex. But it has to be spread easier than just sex too, as there are several children that have contracted it already.   


There are also more gay people today than ever. Look at how many gay bears exist in this sub alone.

Musk aimed his dig at Lucid Motors, an American electric vehicle manufacturer that announced its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday. The EV maker delivered just 679 cars in the second quarter of 2022 ‚Äì a fact that prompted the CEO of Tesla to joke he had had more children in the same time period.

Musk‚Äôs own contribution to the world population aside (the tech billionaire has nine children), his company Tesla also outperformed Lucid in terms of vehicle deliveries. According to Tesla‚Äôs website, the electric automaker ‚Äúproduced over 258,000 vehicles and delivered over 254,000 vehicles‚Äù to Lucid Motors‚Äô 679 cars.

1st of all alot of you seem to not understand the basics of economics and just seem to be playing russian roulette with puts doubling down every game eventhough you won the game for 9 month straight. (Gambling in a casino with hardcore commitment is good as its a 50/50 odds however gambling that the stock market will go down another 70% after some profitable SPACs are down 95% and some blue chips are down 20%+ is just outright bat shit crazy)

2nd of all i see alot of people saying the FED this the FED that which all leads to their theory that the FED have to raise intrest rate to over 9.1% some even said 15% to counter inflation. Alot of you dont seem to understand how FED intrest rates and the 40T debt in bonds are related . The FED have been raising rates at its fastest rate in over 2 decades and you guys seem to feel that a volker move is needed so your puts can print. (If the FED raise intrest rates by 9% or 15% as some of you suggested, the FED would basicly bankrupt the US economy and create a bank run from its foriegn bond investor mostly countries that have strong relations with the US. Ask yourself what will happen to the US role as the world reserve currency when this happens. Sure ur small puts might print and some might even print a 10 bagger but the USD u recieve would be a piece of toilet paper if the treasury fails to repay the intrest rates of their bonds to their bond holders.)",HONEST OPINION AFTER BEING HERE FOR 2 MONTHS,2022-08-05

My older sister used to date a lot of guys. Usually guys that had easy and consistent access to cocaine. Anyway, one of these guys used to work at a hotel in Pennsylvania that Andre the Giant would frequently stay in. He said Andre was too big and too drunk most of the time to wipe his ass with regular toilet paper so he would just wipe his ass with the towels and throw them in a pile for the hotel staff to clean up.

That got me thinking... 

What about a line of disposable towels for for extremely large men to wipe their ass with? This could be a huge money maker for BBBY because large men take frequent large dumps. Somebody get on the horn with Ryan Cohen!

Adenomas are early precancerous polyps that can lead to colorectal cancer and cannot be detected with current invasive blood tests and non-invasive test kits. This is exactly where MB comes in with the ColoFuture study (mRNA-based technology).

  **DraftKings Gains as Sales Beat Expectations, Forecast Raised** 

* Sportsbook‚Äôs 1.5 million monthly users is up 30% from year ago
* Revenue per player is rising as company offers more parlays

By Gerry Smith

(Bloomberg) -- 

DraftKings Inc. raised its full-year revenue forecast as the company continued to sign up new bettors despite decades-high US inflation squeezing consumers‚Äô budgets. The shares gained in early trading.

DraftKings now sees revenue for the year in the range of $2.08 billion to $2.18 billion, up from $2.055 billion to $2.175 billion, the company said Friday. The guidance now includes Golden Nugget Online Gaming Inc., which the company bought in May, as well as new markets like Ontario, Canada.

DraftKings is competing with FanDuel, a division of Irish bookmaker Flutter Entertainment Plc, and other sportsbooks to sign up bettors as more states legalize online sports gambling. The companies have lost hundreds of millions of dollars as they‚Äôve poured money into advertising and promotional offers. A series of forecast boosts for DraftKings suggests the strategy may be paying off.

‚ÄúCustomer engagement remains strong, and we continue to see no perceivable impact from broader macroeconomic pressures,‚Äù DraftKings Chief Executive Officer Jason Robins said in a statement.

The shares rose 3.4% at 8:37 a.m. in New York, paring an earlier gain of as much as 17%. The stock had fallen 40% so far this year through Thursday‚Äôs close, compared with a 13% drop in the S&amp;P 500.

Revenue in the second quarter rose to $466 million, a 57% increase from the year-earlier period. That beat the average of analysts‚Äô expectations at $438 million.

DraftKings has 1.5 million monthly unique paying customers, up 30% from a year ago. That missed analysts‚Äô expectations of 1.7 million, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg, but DraftKings said its bettors are spending more money.

Its average monthly revenue per player rose to $103 in the quarter, up from $80 a year earlier. The company has introduced more parlays -- when bettors can combine multiple wagers into a single bet. Sportsbooks are focused on promoting such riskier bets because they are more profitable.

DraftKings also forecast a narrower loss for the year, in terms of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

A souring economy could threaten the growth of sports betting if consumers start to cut their entertainment spending. In June, several states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey, saw year-over-year declines in gross gaming revenue, according to Stephen Glagola, an analyst at Cowen &amp; Co.

wallstreetbets,"**TLDR:** ASTL has $1.08B market cap, $810M cash on hand, and is making $280M EBITDA a quarter. Just did a $400M share buyback to reduce O/S by 28% and will continue buyback. Closed at $9.20 a share, I‚Äôm all over $10 calls for every month available.

**The Basics:**

Algoma Steel is a 120+ year old steel manufacturer in Canada. The stock (ASTL) trades on both the NASDAQ exchange as well as TSX in Canada. 

On the back of a red hot steel market in 2021, the company went public via a reverse merger with a market cap of approx. $1.5B. At the time, the company had Net Debt (Debt minus Cash) of about $180M.

**Fast-forward to Now:**

Since going public, the company has had a series of blowout earnings reports. In their fiscal year 2022, which is 4/1/21 ‚Äì 3/31/22, the company reported Revenues of about $3.0B, Net Income of about $1.1B, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.17B (all amounts expressed in USD). They reported an additional Adjusted EBITDA of approx. $280M USD for the quarter-ended June 2022. Furthermore, as of 6/30/22, the company has Net Cash (Cash minus Debt) of about $810M USD ‚Äì that represents an improvement of almost $1.0B in the company‚Äôs Net Cash position from when they went public at a $1.5B valuation.

Yet somehow, the company is currently valued at a paltry $1.0B USD despite the massively improved Balance Sheet and the continued blowout earnings reports. 

**Major Share Buyback Completed (28% of O/S):**

Last month (July), the company completed a buyback of approx. 28% of the outstanding shares, reducing the share count from about 147M to 105M. The buyback price was at $9.75 a share or about $1.4B valuation. This buyback was key, because there were existing creditor shareholders (that had ownership from the bankruptcy protection restructuring) that held about 45M shares as of 3/31/22 and those investors had previously signaled their intention to exit their position. The buyback completed by the company in July 2022 was for a total of 41M shares, and that should have cleared out a majority of the legacy investors who wanted to take their profits and exit.

What that means is there is no longer a massive backlog of shares available to be sold by those wishing to exit. Or in other words, the stock is ready for take-off!

**Algoma Steel has Several Advantages Over Peers:**

Despite a recently slowing steel market (HRC prices have declined more than 50% from their highs), this company still stands to make a killing over the next few quarters and beyond. They have several significant competitive advantages which I have highlighted below:

1. **Green Transformation:** The company is currently in the midst of a green transformation to Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steelmaking. This will reduce the company‚Äôs emissions by over 70%, offer cost savings, and also increase production capacity. What makes this even more attractive is the fact that they have significant support from the Canadian government, who has provided debt at very favorable terms (in some case forgivable!) that will cover about $325M USD out of the total $500M USD transformation cost. Justin Trudeau literally went to the company‚Äôs headquarters and made this announcement himself, so when I say they have support of the Canadian government I am not exaggerating

2. **Favorable Pricing on Plate Products:** The company has a sizable portion of their revenue coming from plate products (ARP), which are still near all time high prices despite the recent decline in hot rolled coil products (HRC)

3. **Favorable Forward Pricing due to Contract Realization Lag:** The company contracts out over 60% of their revenue, and that contract pricing is often realized on a quarter lag. What that means is despite recent pullbacks in pricing, the company won‚Äôt feel those impacts until a quarter later than their peers which means they have a longer runway of blowout earnings than peers

4. **Favorable Cost Structure:** In terms of costs, the company has long-term contracts in place that significantly reduces its exposure to commodity price risk for its key inputs. The company recently stated that the only commodity they have some significant sensitivity to is iron ore, and for those who are not aware iron ore prices have dropped dramatically over the last few months

Despite all these advantages, Algoma Steel is being treated like the little brother of the steel industry; it‚Äôs priced at a multiple that is significantly below peers. 

**The Bottom Line:**

Even after factoring in the $400M USD buyback in July 2022, the company has Net Cash of approx. $410M which is over 40% of the company‚Äôs market cap. Said differently, if you were to deduct cash on hand from the market cap, it implies an Enterprise Value of only about $600M (keep in mind the company earned $280M in Adj EBITDA in the past quarter alone!). The company has long-term support of the Canadian government and will be a key part of reducing emissions in Ontario. Beyond that, they are a historic company and a mainstay in the Canadian and North American steel markets.

Although the company did not provide guidance for the upcoming quarter, they are set up to enjoy another quarter of significant profits that are well above historical performance levels. Even if pricing returns to historical averages, these guys are phenomenal operators and I am confident they will continue to be profitable.

What makes this particularly interesting is that within another quarter or two, the company will again have so much cash on hand that they have nothing to do with it besides return it to investors (they arguably do even right now). That likely means either another major share repurchase or a hefty special dividend.",Algoma Steel (ASTL) is a Heck of a Steal (Long DD),2022-08-05

wallstreetbets,"I just finished reviewing the AMC quarter. I am surprised that they still couldn't turn a profit from either a EBITDA or CF perspective, given the return to theatres and pandemic normalization.

Revenue growth surprised me, but cost containment was disappointing, especially film gross margin (admissions - film costs) of only 50% (58%, 58%, 53% and 57% in prior 4 quarters), which is the lowest it has been in a while. I guess this is what peak volume margins look like since Hollywood extracts tougher deals in post-pandemic times than during the pandemic.

The biggest problem is the balance sheet. FCF was -117m. This means the business itself lost $117m in this supposed recovery quarter. I see the revenue recovery, but not the earnings. For the first half of 2022, the company has lost $450m running this business. They need to turn it around, quickly. I'm not sure how they do that given the pandemic recovery should have helped them. The net cash position is the worst it has been in 4 quarters: -4.390B (prior 4: -3.661B, -3.813B, -3.808B, -4.333B).

I have always hoped the ""Apes"" make a lot of money as I have no axe to grind. As an impartial referee, this isn't going to cut it. Profits are necessary. All the shenanigans with stock dividends, mining investments, etc. are all a distraction. The core theatre business has to make money. This was supposed to be the quarter. Didn't happen.

So then why does everything point to August 8? August 8, written as a date, is 8/8. What's more, is that the Chinese have used this date in the past for significant events.

* Summary
* Taiwan plays down concerns, likely to avoid panic
* China staging unprecedented military drills around Taiwan
* Follows visit by U.S. House Speaker Pelosi to Taipei
* China says it will sanction Pelosi over 'vicious' actions
* Pelosi, in Japan, joins PM Kishida in condemning China

TAIPEI, Aug 5 (Reuters) - China's firing of missiles during military drills around Taiwan was an unjustified escalation, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday, as Beijing said it would sanction House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi for visiting the island.

Washington has made it repeatedly clear to Beijing it does not seek a crisis, Blinken told a news conference on the sidelines of the ASEAN Regional Forum in Cambodia as diplomatic ructions continued over Pelosi's visit to the self-governed island that Beijing regards as its sovereign territory.

He said China's actions were disproportionate and significant, and the United States was seriously concerned but would not be provoked, before adding ""there was no possible justification for what they have done"".

China launched its largest ever military drills in the seas and skies around Taiwan on Thursday, a day after Pelosi enraged Beijing by making a solidarity trip to the island. The drills are scheduled to continue until noon on Sunday.

China's foreign ministry announced on Friday that it would sanction Pelosi and her immediate family in response to her ""vicious"" and ""provocative"" actions.

""Despite China's serious concerns and firm opposition, Pelosi insisted on visiting Taiwan, seriously interfering in China's internal affairs, undermining China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, trampling on the one-China policy, and threatening the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,"" a foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement.¬†

On Thursday, China fired multiple missiles into waters surrounding Taiwan in an unprecedented escalation during live-fire exercises.

Japan's defence ministry, which is tracking the exercises, first reported that as many as four of the missiles flew over Taiwan's capital. It also said that five of nine missiles fired toward its territory landed in its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), also a first, prompting a diplomatic protest by Tokyo.

Later, Taiwan's defence ministry said the missiles were high in the atmosphere and constituted no threat. It gave no details of their flight paths, citing intelligence concerns.

Some Taipei residents, including Mayor Ko Wen-je, criticised the government for not putting out a missile alert, but one security expert said that could have been done to avoid stoking panic and playing into China's hands.

""It counteracted the effect of the Chinese Communist Party's psychological warfare,"" said Mei Fu-shin, a U.S.-based analyst. ""The shock and fear were not as great as they could have been.""

Asked to comment on the missiles, Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang did not directly respond, but referred to China as the ""evil neighbour showing off her power at our door.""¬†[read more](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-premier-evil-neighbour-next-door-is-showing-off-her-power-our-door-2022-08-05/)

Bonnie Glaser, a Washington-based Asia security specialist at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, described as ""unprecedented"" reports that ballistic missiles were fired over Taiwan.

About 10 Chinese navy ships and 20 military aircraft briefly crossed the Taiwan Strait median line on Friday morning, a Taiwan source briefed on the matter told Reuters.[¬†read more](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/chinas-military-makes-dozens-crossings-taiwan-median-line-source-2022-08-05/)

Earlier, Taiwan's defence ministry said the island's military had dispatched aircraft and ships and deployed land-based missile systems to monitor the situation there.

""In my view, the larger threat is that China is doing a rehearsal for a blockade, demonstrating it can block Taiwan's ports and airports, and prevent shipping,"" Glaser said.

**'ABYSS OF DISASTER'**

China has said its relations with Taiwan are an internal matter.

Responding to the Chinese drills, President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan would not provoke conflicts but would firmly defend its sovereignty and national security.

Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong's communists took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs Kuomintang (KMT) nationalists in a civil war, prompting the KMT-led government to retreat to the island.

Beijing says it reserves the right to bring Taiwan under Chinese control, by force if necessary.

Pelosi told reporters in Japan, during the final hours of her Asia tour, that China could not isolate Taiwan by preventing Western officials from travelling there.

""This visit isn't about me, it's about Taiwan,"" she said.

During a news conference in Tokyo, Pelosi addressed the diplomatic furore caused by the congressional visit to Asia, and most specifically Taiwan.

""We have said from the start that our representation here is not about changing the status quo in Taiwan or the region,"" she told a news conference after meeting Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

The congressional delegation led by Pelosi visited Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea earlier this week, and wound up in Japan on Friday.

Pelosi met Kishida at his official residence, where the Japanese premier said the two allies would work together to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, an important shipping route.¬†[read more](https://www.reuters.com/world/pelosi-visits-japan-after-taiwan-trip-sparked-outsized-military-drills-by-2022-08-04/)

China's foreign ministry said it had summoned the Japanese ambassador in Beijing on Thursday over its participation in an ""erroneous"" Group of Seven (G7) nations statement on Taiwan, and also made complaints to EU envoys.

Japan, whose southernmost islands are closer to Taiwan than Tokyo, has warned that Chinese intimidation of Taiwan poses an escalating national security threat.

""I have informed speaker Pelosi that the fact China's ballistic missiles had landed near Japanese waters including EEZ threaten our national safety and security and that Japan had strongly condemned such actions,"" Kishida said.

It was fast tracked and pushed into the EUA process due to ‚ÄúOverwhelming efficacy‚Äù
It treats not only ARDS (Acute respiratory distress syndrome) an almost always fatal symptom of COVID, it also treats cancer and has a multitude of other uses that are still being looked into.

They have another drug in production as of now they have yet to start realizing profits on as it‚Äôs new and has passed through the FDA (Entadfi).

They have other drugs in the pipeline as well. This isn‚Äôt some one trick Pony. Not an overnight biotech. They‚Äôve been in business for over 10 years and have tons of operating cash.

All concerns have been thoroughly debunked in regards to sabizabulin.
Random bears and shorts have tried to make nonsensical claims about the testing methods and groups and I will not engage anyone in response to those questions. 
Even just this week a new report was release completely debunking all concerns.
Agencies worldwide are also pushing it through their regulatory systems.
England, Germany and Korea among them. None of them have raised any concerns. (Trust random bears on the internet if you‚Äôd rather take their word for it)
It was just featured in France I heard in biotech winners, a show of some sort.

It‚Äôs currently sitting at a very strong support line that it constantly bounces off of. Usually goes from this point to $16+ while we wait for EUA but holds this $12ish line. When EUA comes through you‚Äôre looking at an easy $50 stock, probably more. 

All of that is nice and all but here‚Äôs the icing on the cake.

""This new AMC Preferred Equity gives AMC a currency that can be used in the future to strengthen our balance sheet, including by paying down debt or raising fresh equity""

Which is the legalese way of saying need money, but it wasn't obvious how. Then I realized they actually have the AMC holders between a rock and a hard place. 

Because the new APE shares are both tradable and voting shares and AMC can issue more, AMC can now further dilute their stock into oblivion and there doesn't appear to be anything AMC holders can do to stop it.

Basically the scheme works like this:

If AMC holders sell their APE shares, voting rights are quickly acquired then APE holders vote to convert APE into AMC. 

If AMC holders hold their APE shares, APE shares go up in price, more APE shares are issued, APE crashes in price, then APE shares are converted in AMC.

As we observed earlier, it should have carried it out to the conjunction  with the second resistance line (yellow) but it suddenly broke up with  that parabolic rise in the price. That is not good nor an healthy price  movement. Aster that we can see that the solid trend the stock built was  disrupted and it retraced back down to the first resistance line. Never  cheer when u see explosions like that, it means a whale jumped out from  the water and the waves will disrupt everything.  

We can expect now to test the 4$ line and make it into a support, if  failed, it has a serious probability to retrace back to 3.8$    The reversal will be determined tomorrow.

 1 Hour Chart: We can see that in the long run, the price is stabilizing above 3$ for a  while and seems to have reached a bottom, with long term support being 3  itself (red) and resistance being $4 (yellow)  We can see that the price broke the long term bear trend (blue).  

We can observe a mid term support forming (orange) that shall cover our  ass up if 4 dollar resistance reject the new price action where we will  climb it until September (normal outcome)    If mid term support fails, we can be sure to test 3$ again (pessimistic)   

If tomorrow we confirm 3$ as the new support, we can expect to stay  above 4 for a while (optimistic)    Seeing how MACD and RSI are moving, i personally thing that we have more  chance for the normal outcome or the optimistic ones.

TUI Group¬†is a German leisure, travel and tourism¬†company, one of the largest in the world. The business model of this company should be known, I'd to shortly DD finical side.   
    
At Feb 2020, the price of TUI shares was¬†over EUR 10, to drop and fluctuate at about 3 euro after Covid starts. The tourism industry has died down, i.e. TUI decided to take a government aid to survive. Founds been mainly taken from¬†the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) bank, the German Economic Stabilization Fund (WSF), called alled ""Silent partnership‚Äù. At June 2021, total debt was ‚Ç¨ 6.8 billion. 

Initially, the plan was to pay off the loans created after Covid from the company's profits, but the protracted pandemic (omicron variant) and uncertainty about the possibility of a quick return of, in particular, airports to pre-pandemic turnover, resulted in the decision of the management of TUI issuing 162,291,441 new shares for the price EUR 2.62 per unit, which was 10% lower than the current market price. The company raised EUR 425 million and informed that it would use this amount to settle part of its debt. Analysts had assumed the possibility of increasing capital in this way long before. As a result, on June 30, the TUI group repaid the second tranche of the aid received in the form of various financial instruments, including state guarantees. It is 725 million euros, this is the amount returned to the Economic Stability Fund, including interest, and they also reduced the credit line from the Reconstruction Fund (KfW) from 2.4 billion to 2.1 billion. The previous tranches in the amount of 700 million TUI paid in April 2022. 

Unfortunately, the issue of new shares, although it helped to pay off the debt, caused the share price to drop. This should come as no surprise as no investor likes to dilute stocks, especially if the capital of these shares is intended for repayment of liabilities. So why did I decide to buy a stake?   
    
TUI has presented a plan to get out of its debt and is implementing it, unlike, for example, the British Rolls Royc, which in my opinion is in a worse position and the management is not able to come up with concrete steps to pay off its huge debts, in return we keep hearing about new plans development of the company (Construction of nuclear mini-reactors), which will certainly generate new costs. This shows that the company's financial policy may be different and short-sighted.   
    
Finally, I would like to point out that the investment in TUI is still a high risk, but in my opinion a healthy financial policy deserves some confidence in the future, therefore I allocated 6% of my portfolio to the purchase of shares with an average purchase price of 1.645

I was going to stay out of this whole mess, but what Adam Aron is doing here is absolutely disgusting and I need to piece out what going on here. 

So to preface, AMC is in dire straits: 

* Its bonds are trading at 60 cents on the dollar. This basically means the markets don't believe AMC will be able to pay out its debt 
* The company has roughly $1B cash vs roughly $5B in debt and $5B in lease liabilities
* They lost money this quarter despite travel and service oriented companies just killing it. 
* Additionally all signs point to a weaker Q3 and Q4 going forward so it is likely Q2 will be their strongest quarter
* And to top it all off, they are unable to issue any shares because retail investors have blocked off any common stock dilution

**So how does a company get out of this without declaring bankruptcy?** They don't. Unless you're Adam Aron.

Well here is Adam's master plan. [The $0.01/share special dividend.](https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2022/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Announces-Special-Dividend-of-AMC-Preferred-Equity-Units/default.aspx) 

The Preferred Equity Unit. 

Here are its important takeaways:

* Each Preferred Equity Unit can be exchanged for 1 common share, but only if **the Company proposes and investors vote to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock**
* Each Preferred Equity Unit represents one hundredth of a share in the company's Preferred Stock (Note: Preferred Equity Unit =/= Preferred Stock!)
* Each Preferred Stock is in turn potentially convertible into 100 shares of Common Stock

Well retail will never vote for dilution... lets move onto the filings. 

* Holders of the Preferred Stock will initially be entitled to one hundred (100) votes per share and will vote together with the holders of common stock [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/1AnTszC.png)
* We may offer and sell, from time to time in one or more offerings, shares of our Class A common stock, par value $0.01 (the ‚Äúcommon stock‚Äù), **preferred stock**, subscription rights, depositary shares, warrants
and units, in amounts, at prices and on terms determined at the time of offering [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/DFe2WwM.png)
* Authorized capital stock of 50M shares of Preferred Stock (45M after the ~500M Preferred Equity Units are delivered) [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/DFe2WwM.png)

Here is where things get dicey. The company is going to issue up to 50M of these preferred shares that have 100 votes per share versus the current 510M common shares outstanding. What this means is owning 5.1 million preferred shares gives you the same amount of votes as all 510M common shares. Additionally, you the shareholder, will receive **Preferred Equity Units**, **not** **Preferred Stock**. **They can issue Preferred Stock, but are only giving you Preferred Equity Units.**

Circling back to the beginning, why does Adam Aron care about these votes so much? Its because AMC needs cash bad. AMC really, really wants to issue more shares, but retail traders understand that dilution = bad and is not willing to allow AMC to screw them over. Well here comes their fix. With these preferred shares, retail traders will not have a choice in the matter when share issuance comes up for a vote the next time around. 

Adam Aron is selling you this whole special dividend as a good thing, something to hurt the short sellers, when in reality its anything but. The Preferred Equity Unit will result in massive dilution for common stock owners. **This is not a good thing.** If you are buying in the hopes of a short squeeze, AMC's actions today directly work against that happening.",The AMC Preferred Equity Unit and how Adam Aron is fleecing retail investors,2022-08-05

It goes on to say, ""Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, which sent commodity prices spiraling higher, has added to the inflationary pressures faced by the Fed and its counterparts around the world. However, soaring energy costs are also expected to sap growth rates, raising questions about how high the Fed   can push rates before it has to stop. In effect, the inversion of the curve implies that some investors think that, after a period of rapid tightening, the Fed will be forced to reverse course."" 

I  am of the belief that the oil market has deep structural supply  problems meaning that energy prices will remain higher for longer. I  don't think inflation will be easy to put a lid on. It may take the fed pushing us into a deep economic recession to get prices under control. If the Fed is forced to reverse  course on interest rate hikes before it can get inflation completely  under control, we may be in store for a prolonged stagflationary  environment possibly resulting in the need for a second tightening  cycle.

After [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wc55x1/transcendental_trading_35_in_2_days/), I was in a dark place.  I had lost about $4,000 and was questioning whether relying  on my transcendental visions was a good investment strategy.  And yet, as I starved (since I had no money for food) I was reminded of the 40 days that Jesus starved in the desert, and of how he managed to resist Satan's offers of bread.  To succeed, I realized, one must hold fast to their faith.

And as I meditated on my next move, I was drawn back to the New Testament.  See, I believe that our future is in fact written in our past: all we need to do is decode it.  Thus, I began at Revelations, where a list of prophecies were laid out for the inevitable Rapture.  What could we learn from it?

In [Revelations 13:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A1&amp;version=KJV), it is said: *""And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. ""*

This Beast is the key to understanding the rapture.  7 heads, 10 horns, 10 crowns, this was a code.  Multiply them and you get 7 x 10 x 10 = **700**.  Something VERY important would happen 700 years after this prophecy was made.

Based on the [calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_Jesus#:~:text=He%20dates%20the%20crucifixion%20to,the%2018th%20year%20of%20Tiberius) of Hippolyus of Rome (one of the most important early Christian theologians), we can date the Crucifixion of Jesus to Friday, March 25th, of the **18th** year of Tiberius.  Knowing that Tiberius began his reign in **A.D. 14**, we can calculate that Jesus died in 18 + 14 = **32 A.D**.  Thus, we know something incredibly important occurred in A.D. 32 + A.D. 700 = **A.D. 732**.

And indeed, this in fact came to pass.  For it was in **A.D. 732** that the Mayans [began construction of the five Temples at Tikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikal_Temple_I).  Now, I believe it was in these temples that the Mayans managed to lock away a great evil.  The first temple, built to house the tomb of  Jasaw Chan K ºawiil, featured a carving with *""****an enormous serpent*** *rising above""* the king.  In addition, the mount of the temple featured *""stone blocks carved to represent the enormous figure of the king,* ***flanked by scrolls and serpents****""*. 

Of course it's no coincidence that serpents are also a symbol of Satan, and were in fact his earliest incarnation in the book of Genesis.  The Mayans knew that they weren't just burying their King, but actually locking away a great, existential evil, which once unleashed would wreak havoc upon mankind.  But in this case, the evil being locked away *wasn't* the King, it was his **Wife,** Lady Kalajuun Une' Mo'.

Here we must return to Genesis, specifically [Genesis 3:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203%3A6&amp;version=KJ21), which states: *""And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof and ate, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he ate.""*  What this tells us is, when evil is introduced, it is typically through a woman, and in Mayan society it was no different.

Lady Kalajuun Une' Mo' would be buried directly across from the King, in the second [Tikal Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikal_Temple_II).  Inscriptions on this temple *""depict a captive upon a platform and bound between* ***two poles*** *being sacrificed with an arrow or a spear""* which references the crucifixion of jesus (he also hung on two pieces of wood, and was pierced by the [Spear of Longinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Lance)).  It was here the great spirit of evil would actually rest, for well over a thousand years.  

But this would come to an end in 1958, when archeologists began excavating the site.  Unbeknownst to them, they were releasing a terrible evil back into the world.  See, 1958 is significant for [another reason](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/about.html#:~:text=Monkeypox%20was%20discovered%20in%201958,the%20virus%20and%20infect%20people): **it was the year that Monkeypox was discovered.**  

Could the outbreak we see today really be indicative of the Rapture, though?  To answer this question we must return once more to Revelations.  First: make no mistake, the Mark of the Beast is physical mark:

From [Revelations 13:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A16&amp;version=KJV): *""And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.""*  This certainly sounds like the lesions that accompany a Monkeypox infection.  But what other indications are there?

From [Revelations 13:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A18&amp;version=KJV): *""Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.""*  This is 666.  This is the number of the Beast.

Consider this: we are currently in our **third** major Monkeypox outbreak.  We are living 22 years after the end of the 2nd millenium.  3 x 222 = **666.**  But if that's not enough to convince you, theres one more thing.

See, I started looking into the various companies that make Monkeypox vaccines.  One of them is called Siga Technologies.  Guess what their address is?

From their [securities registration](https://investor.siga.com/node/8186/html):

**666** THIRD AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017 

I couldn't believe it.  As soon as I saw this, I immediately YOLO'd my entire account into OTM call options.  Specifically, I bought 19 contracts of Sep 16th 17.5C contracts for SIGA at an average $3.50 each, at about 11AM.

Then I promptly took a nap, and woke up four hours later to a 55% gain.  I checked the time: 3:33PM.   
 This was another sign (my costco order # last week was also 333).  Immediately I sold my position, at an average of $5.50 per contract.

wallstreetbets,"Did we finally witness the bulls exhaust themselves or was this just a case of resting to reset the indicators before the next leg up? 

Today once it closes will be the lowest volume day of 2022 so far close under 50 million for the day.

As you can see we have finally broken the 7 day long extreme momentum bull support. Now that does not mean that we broke the full bull channel support it just shows that the extreme bull momentum that started on July 27th until yesterday has been broken. We still have the overall 8 week long bull channel support which will be at about 408.7 tomorrow. 

There are a couple things to point out from today that are key in my opinion. 

This was the lowest volume day of the year which either means we finally saw bulls exhaust themselves or it means no one is ready to buy here but no one is ready to sell here either as they are indecisive of whether we are going higher or lower next.

We are still trading between the daily 100ema and daily 200ema which overall is neutral and I have since last week said that which ever one of those breaks first is the way we are going to go. 

The bears clocked a really nice double top doji in today with 415.6 being the major resistance point. Overall my expectation is that we have another red day tomorrow where we are going to trade between 415.6 and 408.1 (at the extreme). From there I will be looking at the sell off to start on Monday next week before CPI comes on Wednesday August 10th. I highlighted the Friday and Mondays before the last four CPIs and almost all of them the Friday before was the peak. I am working on my CPI post right now and that should be up later tonight too. Overall I am planning to go in on puts EOD tomorrow. 

Now in the off chance that we see bulls come back in with some good volume tomorrow and break that 415.6 resistance level they are going to need to capitalize on that momentum and close over the daily 200ema in order to continue the bull trend next week. Failing to break the daily 200ema tomorrow and especially a hard rejection there tomorrow would all but secure a bearish week next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/mf2t3kflurf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c52ee01b17f6e0e5f7ad0288f21705cb763ad5fe

ES Futures is looking pretty similar, however, its extreme bull trend has not been broken yet and that support will be at 4139 and be key to watch not only over night but intraday tomorrow. Its key resistance to watch will be at the 4177 level and their daily 200ema is at 4183. If bulls fail to break these levels tomorrow it looks like we are seeing the rising wedges fail and I fully expect some down side. 

https://preview.redd.it/k1fc6pamurf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f819667ba9d69dc6c19c0c078d9f378de06eb99

The main takeaway from the weekly charts is that the 415 and 4164 levels continue to remain heavy resistance. We saw a very aggressive rejection there twice this morning and once during power hour today. I suspect that we are going to continue to see this rejection and I will favor downside next week if bears can close under those key levels.

After apples pretty impressive day yesterday it was pretty much a bust today. The most important takeaway from Apple today is that we saw it close out a doji and maintain 166.2 as key resistance. It also failed to break its rising wedge resistance. As you can see by the ‚Äúyou are here‚Äù highlighted with arrow I am expecting a pullback tomorrow and early next week to retest that red line bull channel support down near 161. However, for tomorrow 164.6 remains key support for the bulls to hold. If we see that support break (this support is similar to the one SPY broke today) then we are going to be looking for the next sell off. 

10% challenge-

Today was one of those days where 99% of people probably woulda been better sitting cash gang. I took two small wins today and was pretty happy with that with all things considered. Despite today being a ‚Äúrange‚Äù day this was probably one of the most choppy range days I have seen in a very long time. We had a lot of really big candles with very little follow through. We were blessed with 15 reversals today.

So heres my thought, technically speaking this strategy works because I only do put/calls on movements that have happened over the past 12-14 days with a 90% of the times following a direction (either lower or higher price from the entry price)

Said all that, I was curious about studying on a specific pair, eur/usd.

So heres the thing, is there any way to calculate whats the max amount of 5m (which is what works best for me) candles (for a specific broker) that has happend on a direction? Wouldnt this mean if you can know this number and have always the coberture to jump in again and doubling your position its just matter of time for the price to turn on your side?

**Paramount's goal: transformation to streaming business**

You may have heard of Paramount+. Paramount+ is Paramount's streaming service. Paramount has realized, as we all have, that the future is not in linear television, but in streaming. Paramount wants to become a competitor of Netflix and co. and offer their content on the Internet and in video-on-demand form.

https://preview.redd.it/a6nxrfpsrrf91.png?width=1962&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aecfd3f4eef5ba39037b088639acff855a1a876

They are available globally and already have a wide range of offerings with series from top franchises. They also create original content like Amazon Prime and Netflix. 

You can check out the Wikipedia-List about what content they have. Can't post it because of low karma. Paramount+ has already managed to achieve 140% growth in subscribers and revenue.

**Why it is likely that this transformation will work out**

Many investors seem to assume that it won't work. What they're overlooking is this:

Paramount has a high moat. Paramount includes CBS, Showtime, Paramount Studious, Nickelodeon and other networks. Their sports network is the broadcaster for the NFL, NCAA, PGA, and the UEFA Champions League. Despite Paramount's transformation into a streaming service, the traditional part of the business is still doing well and unlike Netflix, Paramount is able to produce and profitably share its content across all its platforms without depending on streaming. As the quote goes: Content is king

Paramount's strategy is to maximize the quantity and quality of its content, thereby increasing its long-term value to investors. The whole thing is described in detail in this lecture. Really really recommendable (available at their IR page)

The company knows what it's doing. To me, none of this looks at all like a desperate attempt by an outdated company to somehow stay alive. I think the strategy will pay off over the next few years, and with continued adoption of their streaming, potential exclusives as catalysts, and stabilization over the next few years, it will pay to take the risk now. Growth costs, no doubt without, but it's a path that needs to be taken and one that I see as really promising.

500K float is one thing. A lot of stocks have floats like that. The insane short interest  - 2 million or whatever - even that is not unheard of.

What makes this truly unique is the call option contracts coupled with the small float. Retail can spend $3,000 on 100 shares or $3,000 on six $30 call options that cause the option writing funds to buy 600 shares as soon as the contracts go ITM.

There are over 6,000 August call option contracts that are ITM according to Yahoo from strikes ranging from $2.50-$30. That alone is over 600K shares locked in hedge. That doesn't consider the volume on each strike today, the fact that the $35 strikes and likely $40 strikes are going ITM tomorrow and the open interest on the September to February options.

Boy has it been a wild ride down and back up again. Lets recap where we left off.

My last post was this one back when our boy initially made the entry :

Recap:

Cohen wrote a letter to BBBY about selling or spinning off its buy buy baby business. At the time Cohen evaluated this business is worth billions of dollars:

Cohens position:

The entire thesis on this play is that BBBY is not going bankrupt but instead quite the opposite is taking shape. Thus making BBBY a deep value play as all they have to do is solve their expenses and they can do this several ways including a sell off or spin off of buy buy baby.

I personally am leaning towards the spinoff idea and you can read a very in depth overview here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/w0ix7z/cohen\_and\_the\_coke\_connection/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/w0ix7z/cohen_and_the_coke_connection/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

But the spark notes is that when a spin off occurs, the owners of shares in the parent company are given these shares in the spinoff proportionate to what they own. Considering Buy Buy Baby would have a stand alone market cap of ""several billion dollars"". This is justified as the trailing 12 month revenue sits at 1.3B and they are growing the revenue at low double digits.

So every BBBY share is literally a golden ticket in the event of a spinoff that grants you these shares down the line if/when buy buy baby is spun off. YOU would be that person that owns the shares pre IPO for once before any hype or anything like this.

Keep in mind that BBBY is dancing around a 500M market cap. Just a 1 billion valuation (which is a very mild af valuation) for a component of the company is a easy double up without even trying let alone all the other factors we get to discuss next :)

You see while BBBY has been in the dumpster, it has quietly been building a massive ramp in the options to Cohens strikes. Simply take a look at these:

&amp;#x200B;

10k contracts ITM with another 30k contracts ITM if it gets to 10 bucks by Aug 19

Now heres the really impressive picture:

Yes you read that correctly. 45,663 at the $10 strike alone and still have 5 months to go! 23,798 at 20 with many thousands in-between.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6hu6n9godrf91.png?width=1941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7d715f9c35b2ac8481f89db9fb3063f41d13881

The classical strikes.

Cohen has strikes from 60 to 80. You can see here these are heavy numbers too. If we get to 60 it puts 35,659 just at that strike ITM and if we get to 80 well I think the great sneeze explains itself. Gonna need alot of Kleenex on this one.

These are just the options. Lets go ahead and get started in on the shares as the big boys have been taking positions while everyone else is asleep since 06/30 (right after the ugly earnings report):

I gave the last picture its own separate photo as there is some things to discuss on it.

On July 20th, essentially what appears to be a dressed up WSB user with some fancy quant knowledge offered BBBY an option to restructure its debt via bonds by injecting a billion in cash and increasing the long term debt while reducing interest payments. I am personally unsure if this is good or bad but I trust whatever Cohen does or does not do here. Considering how much time has passed, its unlikely this proposal is being considered but who knows!. Here is their letter:

[https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/a100cee3-fff5-4478-9869-6e34ada2ad0f](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/a100cee3-fff5-4478-9869-6e34ada2ad0f)

They did a AMA on twitter recently that was interesting. They mentioned regardless of accepting the proposal they are going to hold anyway. Why wouldn't they? They know its a 10 bagger plus too.

You can see all the shares trading hands here:

[https://whalewisdom.com/stock/bbby](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/bbby)

Did the math and there is a net positive of 5,817,699 shares purchased by funds sine 06/30. Who knows who has bought more of BBBY since 06/30. Quite clearly ALOT of buying is still going on as everyone knows a company that does revenues of.

Unfortunately for most people there is a big problem BBBY is facing. Its shares are sadly going extinct!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kxkb6vhvdrf91.png?width=495&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efc277b57b25a7640c5832282f373e565120c7fb

Float data:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dzrbjmawdrf91.png?width=444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8581a48c00832491fe4f2dec6f0ad26a715484f4

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/key-statistics?p=BBBY

According to the statistics here, there's a float of 69.45M and outstanding of 79.96M

At face value considering the recent whale wisdom data and RC, you have 5,817,699 shares and RC alone has 9,450,100. So there is a combined 15,267,799 just looking at 06/30 and including RC.

Including the shares short of 28.56M this would equate to 43,827,799. But heres where it gets even more wild:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8i8cfr1xdrf91.png?width=1731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87d3c016faca903b273b6a1035d18d3e01a54c23

If you total up the top holdings disregarding the calls/puts you get 71,360,716 shares currently held by the whales.

So you tell me how we have 71,360,716 shares tied up by longs on 79.96M shares outstanding. Let alone if we include the short position then you would have 71,360,716+ 24,620,000 shares short = 95,980,716 shares being tied up.

Now I don't know who exactly fell asleep at the wheel here but the share scarcity is real. Its so real that invisible shares must exist and the funds who are bearish are basically playing a hybrid game of Russian Roulette and chicken with each other on who is going to roll over on who first. You can even see here there is hardly any shares available compared to what normally is available:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a84fckvxdrf91.png?width=1059&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cd05599ec3cb63f6dde62893f3ffafb8efe1e8d

Yesterday at close there was only 200 shares!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qpxhtjkydrf91.png?width=494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f8521d765ffb2694cecc9e375c9c2c871583930

Lets cover some logic here. BBBY is a 500M company according to the market.

Q1 2022: 1.46B in revenue

Q4 2021: 2.05B in revenue

Q3 2021: 1.88B in revenue

Q2 2021: 1.98B in revenue

So the trailing 12 months of revenue here is 7.37B in revenue according to markets = 500M market cap...I'll let ya'll work out how to justify that low valuation.

The last thing to look at here is that Tritton is gone. He was ousted in June and the board was replaced being downsized to 10 member forwhich 3 are RC's own people.

The company has been doing everything Cohen is asking of them. Not giving guidance on earnings calls, moving inventory out into the market space and creating value in buy buy baby with partnerships.

Bed Bath is already a Kroger partner:

In fact BBBY is getting so aggressive that they dont even gaf if you have a baby or not, they finna knock on your door and sell to you regardless:

If you know anything about Karen's, they are perfect for publicity and good sales people obtain opinions from everyone instead of being scared to get rejected. Seeing this type of aggressive marketing is incredibly bullish as BBBY is out to move this inventory regardless.

Ok the very last thing is the shareholders meeting July 14. Here is what specifically was said (no transcript exists but I did one myself):

[https://central.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/vsm/web?pvskey=BBBY2022](https://central.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/vsm/web?pvskey=BBBY2022)

At the 18 min mark:

Before I turn the call over to Suzie for questions I want to reiterate my belief in our ability to drive improvement and my optimism in the future for our company.

**We look forward to updating you on our continued progress by the end of next month**

Q: What are your plans for buy buy baby? Do you intend to keep and grow it? Spin it off as a separate company or sell it?

A: Thank you Suzie this is Harriett. The strategy committee of our board has done a great deal of work evaluating the potential of our buy buy baby business.

The analysis to date has confirmed and dimensionalzed the attractiveness of buy buy baby and identified several options for this business. The committee is working closely with the board and both strategic and financial advisors to properly assess value potential.

Once a specific path is determined. The board will consider all shareholder and capital implications, discuss it with management and our advisors and update you when the work is complete.

Q: In a buy buy baby spinoff would you consider distributing a portion of the companies shares to BBBY shareholders as a dividend?""

Well as I mentioned first we have to determine a specific path and then the board will consider all options before it and uh again **look forward to an update in the future.**

**TLDR;**

BBBY ousted the CEO, created a new board controlled and being obeyed by Cohen. The shares are becoming an endangered species as there appears to be more in play than officially exist and history tends to repeat itself. 7.37B in sales at a 500M market cap. 5M plus shares bought by funds since just 06/30 and tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of options open interest are creating a massive ramp as the stock appreciates. Buy Buy Baby could be spun off to existing shareholders that will be distributed making your shares golden tickets to free buy buy baby shares before it would be publicly traded. BBBY is done playing around and is getting aggressive af even getting Karen's nice and angry while creating numerous partnerships to increase its own inherent value of several billion dollars doing 1.3B in sales on its own in the trailing 12 months ending 03/31 (Q2 2021-Q1 2022).

Multiple Catalysts exist. RC buying more shares (remember when Cohen bought more GME 4 months after their initial buy before the sneeze?). Another whale buying more shares. Spinning off Buy Buy Baby, selling Buy Buy Baby, forging new partnerships with Buy Buy Baby. Restructuring the debt, moving all the backlogged inventory that has built up successfully.

These are just the options. Lets go ahead and get started in on the shares as the big boys have been taking positions while everyone else is asleep since 06/30 (right after the ugly earnings report):

I gave the last picture its own separate photo as there is some things to discuss on it. 

On July 20th, essentially what appears to be a dressed up WSB user with some fancy quant knowledge offered BBBY an option to restructure its debt via bonds by injecting a billion in cash and increasing the long term debt while reducing interest payments. I am personally unsure if this is good or bad but I trust whatever Cohen does or does not do here. Considering how much time has passed, its unlikely this proposal is being considered but who knows!. Here is their letter: 

[https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/a100cee3-fff5-4478-9869-6e34ada2ad0f](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/a100cee3-fff5-4478-9869-6e34ada2ad0f)

They did a AMA on twitter recently that was interesting. They mentioned regardless of accepting the proposal they are going to hold anyway. Why wouldn't they? They know its a 10 bagger plus too. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can see all the shares trading hands here:

[https://whalewisdom.com/stock/bbby](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/bbby)

Did the math and there is a net positive of 5,817,699 shares purchased by funds sine 06/30. Who knows who has bought more of BBBY since 06/30. Quite clearly ALOT of buying is still going on as everyone knows a company that does revenues of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately for most people there is a big problem BBBY is facing. Its shares are sadly going extinct! 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sfjzphba6rf91.png?width=495&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf7e3347327b628f5ee4f3dbfa8e7728240bf8e3

Float data:

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/BBBY\/key-statistics?p=BBBY](https://preview.redd.it/cst8ecoxwqf91.png?width=444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbac335198abb5afa140fabd6df14b6049fbf359)

According to the statistics here, there's a float of 69.45M and outstanding of 79.96M 

At face value considering the recent whale wisdom data and RC, you have 5,817,699 shares and RC alone has 9,450,100. So there is a combined 15,267,799 just looking at 06/30 and including RC. 

Including the shares short of 28.56M this would equate to 43,827,799. But heres where it gets even more wild:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s16jgwyl0rf91.png?width=1731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19450adf2f3d3568a58cb5ee547794e0b87330e0

If you total up the top holdings disregarding the calls/puts you get 71,360,716 shares currently held by the whales. 

So you tell me how we have 71,360,716 shares tied up by longs on 79.96M shares outstanding. Let alone if we include the short position then you would have 71,360,716+ 24,620,000 shares short = 95,980,716 shares being tied up.  

Now I don't know who exactly fell asleep at the wheel here but the share scarcity is real. Its so real that invisible shares must exist and the funds who are bearish are basically playing a hybrid game of Russian Roulette and chicken  with each other on who is going to roll over on who first. You can even see here there is hardly any shares available compared to what normally is available:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vr5aq4hf1rf91.png?width=1059&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dda4db027f894e8aa1e913fe5ffe9e8dd011e4e

Yesterday at close there was only 200 shares!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hvpjxttj1rf91.png?width=494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c047080bc00f8d210fb42f147c875085940d3cac

Lets cover some logic here. BBBY is a 500M company according to the market. 

Q1 2022: 1.46B in revenue 

Q4 2021: 2.05B in revenue 

Q3 2021: 1.88B in revenue 

Q2 2021: 1.98B in revenue 

So the trailing 12 months of revenue here is 7.37B in revenue according to markets = 500M market cap...I'll let ya'll work out how to justify that low valuation. 

The last thing to look at here is that Tritton is gone. He was ousted in June and the board was replaced being downsized to 10 member forwhich 3 are RC's own people. 

The company has been doing everything Cohen is asking of them. Not giving guidance on earnings calls, moving inventory out into the market space and creating value in buy buy baby with partnerships. 

Bed Bath is already a Kroger partner:

&amp;#x200B;

In fact BBBY is getting so aggressive that they dont even gaf if you have a baby or not, they finna knock on your door and sell to you regardless: 

[https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2022/08/how-it-feels-when-bed-bath-beyond-thinks-youre-pregnant/](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2022/08/how-it-feels-when-bed-bath-beyond-thinks-youre-pregnant/)

If you know anything about Karen's, they are perfect for publicity and good sales people obtain opinions from everyone instead of being scared to get rejected. Seeing this type of aggressive marketing is incredibly bullish as BBBY is out to move this inventory regardless. 

Ok the very last thing is the shareholders meeting July 14. Here is what specifically was said (no transcript exists but I did one myself): 

 [https://central.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/vsm/web?pvskey=BBBY2022](https://central.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/vsm/web?pvskey=BBBY2022) 

 

At the 18 min mark:

Before I turn the call over to Suzie for questions I want to reiterate my belief in our ability to drive improvement and my optimism in the future for our company.

**We look forward to updating you on our continued progress by the end of next month**

Q: What are your plans for buy buy baby? Do you intend to keep and grow it? Spin it off as a separate company or sell it?

A: Thank you Suzie this is Harriett. The strategy committee of our board has done a great deal of work evaluating the potential of our buy buy baby business.

The analysis to date has confirmed and dimensionalzed the attractiveness of buy buy baby and identified several options for this business. The committee is working closely with the board and both strategic and financial advisors to properly assess value potential.

Once a specific path is determined. The board will consider all shareholder and capital implications, discuss it with management and our advisors and update you when the work is complete.

Q: In a buy buy baby spinoff would you consider distributing a portion of the companies shares to BBBY shareholders as a dividend?""

Well as I mentioned first we have to determine a specific path and then the board will consider all options before it and uh again **look forward to an update in the future.**

**TLDR;**

BBBY ousted the CEO, created a new board controlled and being obeyed by Cohen. The shares are becoming an endangered species as there appears to be more in play than officially exist and history tends to repeat itself. 7.37B in sales at a 500M market cap. 5M plus shares bought by funds since just 06/30 and tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of options open interest are creating a massive ramp as the stock appreciates. Buy Buy Baby could be spun off to existing shareholders that will be distributed making your shares golden tickets to free buy buy baby shares before it would be publicly traded. BBBY is done playing around and is getting aggressive af even getting Karen's nice and angry while creating numerous partnerships to increase its own inherent value of several billion dollars doing 1.3B in sales on its own in the trailing 12 months ending 03/31 (Q2 2021-Q1 2022). 

Multiple Catalysts exist. RC buying more shares (remember when Cohen bought more GME 4 months after their initial buy before the sneeze?). Another whale buying more shares. Spinning off Buy Buy Baby, selling Buy Buy Baby, forging new partnerships with Buy Buy Baby. Restructuring the debt, moving all the backlogged inventory that has built up  successfully.

wallstreetbets,"The inversion of the Treasury yield curve deepened Wednesday as the market proved volatile once again, with yields surging on the back of increased confidence about the prospect of Federal Reserve hiking interest rates and then tumbling anew before the day was out.

The gap between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields shifted to a fresh extreme, with the longer rate dropping to be as much as 38 basis below the longer benchmark. That level on the widely watched yield curve metric, seen by many as a potential harbinger of recession, hasn‚Äôt been seen since 2000.

The benchmark 10-year rate climbed as much as 10 basis points to 2.85% during the US morning, while shorter-dated yields rose even more as traders briefly moved to price in the potential for a 75-basis-point Fed hike next month at around 1-in-2. By late in the US afternoon though, short-end yields were close to where they ended the prior day, while longer end rates were falling, with the 10-year ending around 2.70%. The slide weighed on the greenback, with the Bloomberg dollar index down marginally for the day after being up close to 0.4% at one stage during the session.

‚ÄúYields rose to levels that looked attractive and the buyers started with the back end and it feels like cash was being put to work in fixed income,‚Äù said George Goncalves, head of US macro strategy at MUFG. ‚ÄúThere is no sense of a catalyst, but the fact the market can‚Äôt hold higher rates suggests there is some skepticism among investors that the Fed will not really deliver on its tough talk.‚Äù

A cavalcade of comments by Fed officials and stronger-than-expected data on the US services sector helped drive the earlier move up in yields, while US stocks also advanced for the day.

The moves are just the latest in a long line of intraday reversals seen in the market recently. With uncertainty over growth, inflation and central bank policy having picked up, there has been an increase in daily moves of this scale over recent months and a concomitant pickup in various volatility measures.

Yet even with the pullback late Wednesday, rates on key benchmarks remain above the levels they were at as recently as Monday, with much of the enormous surge in yields seen Tuesday still being maintained.",YOLO: Treasury Curve Inversion Deepens as Yields Jump and Then Plunge,2022-08-05

wallstreetbets,"Block, Inc., formerly Square, Inc., is an American financial services and digital payments company based in San Francisco, California. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey (the twitter guy) and Jim McKelvey and launched its first platform in 2010.

Consider the fact that the company's stock has retreated about 51% in 2022, the stock has under-performed versus the S&amp;P 500, which is down nearly 15%. Amid rising fears of a U.S. recession, one question is how resistant Square-parent Block (SQ) will be to a business downturn versus other digital payment companies.

**Square Stock: Earnings Due Aug.4**

https://earningswhispers.com/stocks/sq

Square on Jan. 31 closed the acquisition of Australia-based consumer lending startup Afterpay. The integration of Afterpay into financial segments and rise in popularity of beetcoin will lead to higher growth. 

In its core business, Square stock aims to build a two-sided digital payments ecosystem, with products designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers. The Square Cash App helps individuals manage money, buy stocks and cryptocurrency, and more.

Cash App user growth and monetization is key to the outlook for SQ stock. Cash App growth soared during the coronavirus pandemic amid government economic stimulus and the rise of sex workers (digital e-girls). However, the bearish view is that Cash App growth will slow as the U.S. economy normalizes.

**Square Stock: Cash App Growth Key**

At the investor day, Square said the Cash App now has 46 million monthly active users, up from 44 million at the end of 2021. Some Cash App metrics were a bright spot when Square reported March-quarter earnings. The company reported earnings, revenue, operating profit and gross payment volume that missed analyst estimates, despite lowered expectations.

Square is diversifying on the merchant side. Merchants with less than $125,000 in annual payment volume represented only 34% of Square's gross payment volume mix in December, down from 57% in 2016, noted a UBS report.

Square and Twitter (TWTR) had the same CEO in Dorsey. But Dorsey resigned as Twitter CEO in late 2021, ending the executive-sharing arrangement. Under Dorsey, Square embraced cryptocurrency. At RBC Capital, analyst Daniel Perlin says corn is more than a consumer acquisition tool for SQ stock. Block in 2021 said it plans to build a system for mining. In addition, Square created a new business line to help developers build financial services products focused on corn.

**Square Stock: Big Bet On Buy Now, Pay Later**

In a recent note, Perlin said Block aims to build infrastructure that enables creepto-based commerce on its merchant platform.

""Digital coins like bee-tea-sea remains a small and volatile contributor today, but could develop into a more cohesive strategy and financial contributor longer-term,"" he wrote.

Announced Aug. 1, the Afterpay deal was originally valued at [$29 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-square-to-buy-afterpay-square-earnings/). With the big drop in Block stock, the deal was valued at less than $15 billion at closing. Afterpay competes in the emerging ""[buy now, pay later](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/buy-now-pay-later-consumer-financing-takes-on-credit-cards/)"" market that encroaches on credit card networks. Apple (AAPL) has emerged as a rival to Afterpay with another being Affirm Holdings (AFRM). Some investors questioned whether Block needed to buy a company in this sector as opposed to building up its own capabilities or partnering. Competition is heating up in the buy now, pay later market. Block's 2022 guidance includes an expected $1 billion in Afterpay operating expenses. UBS analyst Rayna Kumar in a report said the ""risk profile"" of Afterpay has changed amid rising interest rates and the potential of increased regulation.

Square stock surged in 2020 during the coronavirus outbreak as investors focused on the growth of its consumer Cash App. They shrugged off worries over Square stock exposure to small businesses and restaurants that might close because of the coronavirus pandemic.

**Square Stock: Payments Ecosystem**

For merchants, Square makes credit-card readers that plug into mobile devices. Its Square Capital division provides loans to sellers. While Square retains only 10% of Square Capital loans on its balance sheet, there's still a risk of defaults.

Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, SQ stock analysts were divided on whether Square revenue growth would reaccelerate with margin improvement following a period of elevated investments. The Square Cash App, a peer-to-peer money-transfer service, competes with PayPal's [Venmo](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/), Zelle and others. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Cash App emerged as a digital alternative to traditional banks. Consumers used the Cash App's direct-deposit feature to receive government stimulus payments, for example. But Cash App gross profit growth slowed over the summer, analysts say, as stimulus programs expired.

Square is testing a short-term borrowing feature for Cash App users. Square offers loans of $20 to $200. Cash App users are expected to pay pack the loans in four weeks, with interest. Also, the Cash App provides a stock trading feature. Cash App offers a debit card through a deal with Marqeta.

The Square Cash app, Square Capital and Instant Deposit all contribute to the company's subscription and services revenue. Analysts have said that one key for Square is cross-selling more services to its existing pool of merchants.

To broaden its consumer platform, Square plans to buy Credit Karma's tax business for $50 million in cash. It's a free service for consumers.

**Block Stock: Moving Upmarket To Bigger Sellers**

With roots in serving such micromerchants as food trucks and farm-stand vendors, Square has moved ""upmarket,"" targeting larger businesses.

SQ stock ranks among the top 10 fintech companies. Bigger fintech companies include Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), PayPal, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), Fiserv (FISV) and American Express (AXP).

In addition to selling credit-card readers, Square provides software for point-of-sale and back offices in order to manage inventory and other tasks.

Square recently focused on software products that can be used across many industries, such as invoicing, payroll and marketing. It also aims to integrate its payment tools into e-commerce platforms. Block on May 18 said it has acquired privately held GoParrot, a digital ordering and marketing platform for restaurants.

**Instant Deposit Speeds Up Process**

The company's Square Instant Deposit allows merchants to immediately receive payments instead of waiting a few days for settlement.

Meanwhile, Square Card is a business prepaid debit card issued in partnership with Sutton Bank to small business owners on the Square platform.

Square on March 2 said its Utah-based industrial bank has launched services to small businesses. Called Square Financial Services, the bank will offer loans and deposit accounts.

In trying to move upmarket, Square takes on Worldpay and Global Payments (GPN). [Some fintech companies are merging](https://www.investors.com/all-categories/tss-stock-gpn-stock-merger-talks/), giving them greater scale vs. Square. The company recently sold Caviar, a food ordering and delivery service, to DoorDash for $410 million.

One key question as competition heats up is the outlook for the gross payment volume ‚Äî total volume of sales in dollars generated by merchant customers ‚Äî also known as GPV. It's a key financial metric for rivals like PayPal as well.

**SQ Stock Fundamental Analysis**

Square earnings for the first quarter were 18 cents per share on an adjusted basis, down 56% from the year-earlier period. Analysts had projected earnings of 20 cents a share.

Square said revenue dropped 21% to $3.96 billion, as Cash App transactions for digital cryptocurrency fell. Analysts had predicted revenue of $4.14 billion.

Financial analysts also view operating income as a key metric for SQ stock. Operating income came in at $1.29 billion, up 34%, versus estimates of $1.30 billion.

Gross payment volume from merchant customers rose 31% to $43.5 billion, versus estimates of $45.39 billion.

In a letter to shareholders, management said: ""Afterpay contributed $92 million of gross profit in the months of February and March, with $46 million of gross profit recognized in each of Cash App and Square.""

Excluding Afterpay, the company said ""gross profit was $1.20 billion, up 25% year over year.""

**Block Stock Technical Analysis**

After its disappointing initial public offering in November 2015, Square stock meandered. In June 2016, SQ stock still traded just above its initial public offering price of 9.

That soon changed. Square stock went on a big run starting in 2016. One analyst called [Square the next FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/what-are-fang-stocks-faang-stocks/), joining the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google in stature.

Following its big run, Square stock fell more than 50% in late 2018 as many technology companies also crashed. Not many stocks roar back after a 50% correction. It takes time for them to digest gains and set up for another extended surge into new highs. SQ stock clawed back in 2019.

# Introduction to SFTs

The DTCC (specifically the NSCC) offers a central clearing service for Security Financing Transactions or SFTs. SFTs are a type of securities lending transaction (a way to borrow stock). Technically, SFTs encompass multiple types of lending transactions. The DTCC Learning Center provides a brief overview of the service ‚Äì follow the link I‚Äôve included below to learn more. Unfortunately, there is very little publicly available data on SFT clearing, similar to what we see with the Obligation Warehouse. In my opinion, SFTs are a **CRITICAL** piece of this puzzle that I have yet to see discussed on reddit (maybe I missed this). I believe SFTs are one of the main, if not THE main, tool being used to manage FTDs and avoid GME hitting RegSHO. Please keep in mind that due to the fungible nature of shares, the purpose of the settlement system (in the eyes of finance) is to move risk through a system and not to ensure 1:1 settlement and delivery.

&gt;*Okay well that sounds complicated, what is an SFT in plain terms?*

SFTs are a different way to borrow stock. They are overnight borrows of stock in exchange for money. Basically, they work like a reverse repo (RRP) but for equities and other securities instead of treasuries. A borrower posts cash collateral and receives securities (such as GME shares) in return. Like RRP, SFTs are overnight transactions and need to be rolled forward each day. This means new rates are calculated and paid daily.

&gt;*What‚Äôs the point? Just sounds like more borrowing.*

First, let‚Äôs take a moment to summarize a few key aspects of the GME situation. As I wrote about in a previous post, everything revolves around the concept of netting. Particularly pertinent to GME is the DTCC‚Äôs Continuous Net System (CNS). This is the central DTCC system which calculates a single obligation for each security after netting all CNS-eligible (which is most trades in stocks, options, MBS, Fixed Income, etc.) obligations resulting from trading each day. The result is each member (banks/brokers) either receives or must deliver shares that day. After this, each member can fulfill obligations by marking shares from their accounts for delivery, failing to deliver, borrowing shares then delivering borrows shares to kick the can, or use some other means of dealing with the obligation so as to meet overall DTCC master margin requirements, Regulation T requirements, and Net Capital Requirements. Due to multilateral netting agreements, swaps, options, swaptions, and other instruments can be used to net against delivery obligations. There have been a plethora of excellent DD pieces written that explore all of these topics in detail and show how they are used to avoid FTDs.

All the methods for dealing with delivery obligation described above are within the confines of the CNS. Importantly, there are at least two ways to get delivery obligations OUT of the CNS and reduce CNS delivery obligations to make it easier to net against shares owed. One of these is the Obligations Warehouse which has been covered in other DD pieces, including by Dr. Trimbath, yet still remains mysterious.  The second way to get delivery obligations out of the CNS is through SFTs. I have yet to see this explored so I felt compelled to share my understanding and thoughts. I don‚Äôt know about you, but it is INCREDIBLY ALARMING to me that there are ways to move delivery obligations out of the CNS. In my opinion that seems counter-intuitive to promoting timely delivery of securities. Although from the perspective of reducing systemic risk by literally moving risk out of the main settlement system and providing alternate pathways to move risk through the overall system, it makes perfect sense as it makes it much more difficult for the DTCC (or any member thereof) to get stuck holding any bags.

&amp;#x200B;

Let‚Äôs see what the DTCC/NSCC says about SFTs:

Just so we are clear ‚Äì ALD or Agency Lending Disclosure is a set of rules requiring reporting of securities lending including ensuring borrowers and lenders stay within regulatory capital constraints. This also is how the locate requirement works ([https://globalriskconsult.com/blog/agency-lending-disclosure-requirements-explained/](https://globalriskconsult.com/blog/agency-lending-disclosure-requirements-explained/)) See snippets below.

&amp;#x200B;

The NSCC freely admits that SFTs can and are used to fulfil FTDs (Why an overnight stock loan is allowed to be used to satisfy a delivery obligation is beyond me‚Ä¶). What‚Äôs more? They provide liquidity! How absolutely wonderful! If you are a Broker Dealer like CitSec, you can now make liquidity dirt cheap by borrowing through SFTs, dumping borrowed shares on the market, and each day roll existing SFTs and open new ones for the tiny cost of the SFT transaction. This cost is specifically called a price differential (PD) and is calculated each day for rolling/novating/opening new SFTs. This is typically the difference in share price each day. Just like any other shorting, you get the money when you sell the shares so this is much cheaper than the price of a share or paying high borrow fees. Isn‚Äôt liquidity just magical!

# Quick Recap

* SFTs are a new way to borrow stock.
* By borrowing stock through SFTs a firm can completely avoid important reporting and locating requirements as well as rules regarding credit risk.
* SFTs provide an avenue for taking delivery obligations out of the CNS (Separate DTCC/NSCC account but still is netted for net capital purposes, obligations, and master margin.
* SFTs are used to cover FTDs and provide liquidity.
* Prior to this June SFTs were cleared outside of the NSCC but SR-NSCC-2022-03 now allows NSCC to clear SFTs through their central SFT Clearing Service. This makes the entire SFT process and netting much easier/streamlined as it all occurs through DTCC subsidiaries. ([https://finadium.com/dtcc-receives-sec-approval-to-launch-nscc-sft-ccp-services/](https://finadium.com/dtcc-receives-sec-approval-to-launch-nscc-sft-ccp-services/))

# Summary of SFT Usage for FTDs

1. DTCC members (firms) avoid FTDs in the CNS through netting against derivatives such as options and swaps due to multilateral netting agreements. This can be a capital-intensive process and eventually has limits.
2. FTDs begin to pile up as a firm nears its capacity to net against delivery obligations in the CNS (or nears its net capital or margin requirements).
3. To alleviate some of this pressure (read: risk) a firm opens SFTs and delivers the borrowed shares. Now, they have a delivery obligation for the next day to fulfill their SFT as they are overnight transactions. It is important to note that the existing delivery obligation in the CNS has now been fulfilled/closed out. Now, the firm has a delivery obligation OUTSIDE of the CNS through the NSCC SFT Clearing Service. (More about delivery obligations: [https://dtcclearning.com/products-and-services/settlement/deliver-orders.html](https://dtcclearning.com/products-and-services/settlement/deliver-orders.html))
4. The next day the same number of shares are due, this time to the SFT counterparty. Firms simply roll their SFTs. Basically, this is opening a new SFT and delivering the borrowed shares to fulfill the delivery obligation from the previous SFT. The NSCC simplifies this process by simply charging the firm the difference in share price from day to day (this is called a mark-to-market charge or sometimes price differential) to roll existing SFTs instead of opening new positions. The cost to roll SFTs is trivial compared to borrowing stock through traditional stock loan programs as it is essentially interest-free (2% excess margin posted but that is still owned by the firm not owed). If liquidity is needed one can simply open more SFTs and sell the borrowed stock, collect the cash, and simply roll the SFT indefinitely. **This is a new/alternate form of shorting.**
5. The best part (from a firm‚Äôs perspective) of the whole thing is that all of that occurs outside of the CNS. This means **no CNS fails when shorting through SFTs** (what is tracked and reported to SEC ‚Äì literally read the filename CNS fails). Furthermore, this alleviates the pressure on the firm for CNS clearing and now the firm has much more free capital and a larger buffer for CNS netting.
6. The firm just continues happily rolling SFTs until the end of time or until they short it down and close out SFTs.

An interesting thing to note about SFTs is that the NSCC requires collateral posted as a mix of cash and Treasury Securities. This means that firms using SFTs must borrow or otherwise have treasuries to post as collateral.

# Enter GameStop with the GameStopper

While SFTs sound better to a short firm than coke to a fratboy, GameStop just put a stop to the party through something called an Unsupported Corporate Action. This should have nuked any short firm using SFTs without a single possibility of escape. Clearly this did not happen which leads us to the smoking gun. To better understand this, read this walkthrough of what happens to SFTs in the event of a corporate action. Everything below comes from the DTCC SFT Clearing Services Guide linked to me by a kind ape. I highly recommend looking through this as I believe it explains much more of what we are seeing than what I address here: e.g. look at the different timelines for intraday events then look at what happens each day at those times on the chart. (You can find that here: [https://pdfhost.io/v/UPUCBW.4d\_](https://pdfhost.io/v/UPUCBW.4d_))

&amp;#x200B;

The important takeaway here is that SFTs are exited (read: force-closed) in the event of an unsupported corporate action. Yes, every single SFT needs to be closed, no matter how long it has been rolled for. Here is a bit more information on what that process looks like. You can read more about the exact timeline and mechanics of how an NSCC Exit (and a lender recall) are executed in the SFT guide.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lk8jtmkkrqf91.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bae14db7b257a698e7224e48b3d6da5155aa2f7f

This is the real reason that the distinction between the GME splividend being processed as a stock split or a stock dividend is so important. Almost every single post I have read about this has missed the mark and misunderstood netting/settlement/depositories in general. Brokers aren‚Äôt involved ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt really matter how the brokers processed it (other than for tax purposes or for beneficial ownership/legal reasons ‚Äì i.e. German law) as THE ONLY DELIVERY OF SHARES THAT OCCURS IS FROM COMPUTERSHARE TO DRS APES AND THE DTCC. Once in the DTCC, the new shares are processed internally and allocated to member accounts as described in the NSCC rules. Since member account allocations are all on a net basis, and splitting doesn‚Äôt change netting even if issued through divi, this is a moot point. The DTCC doesn‚Äôt actually deliver anything to anybody. However, this is of the utmost importance as a stock dividend is considered an unsupported corporate action for the purposes of SFTs. This means that the GME splividend should have forced all outstanding SFTs to close and block new SFTs from opening for several days. Due to this delay and inability to use SFTs to net against a sudden mountain of FTDs resulting from moving the SFT delivery obligations back into CNS, GME should have hit the RegSHO threshold list within 2 weeks following the 18th.

Clearly it did not which presents two possibilities; Either I am wrong about SFTs being the main mechanism by which GME has been controlled (I don‚Äôt think so as all of the evidence, including the NSCC‚Äôs own words, support this) or the DTCC/NSCC processed it as a normal Stock Split which is a supported corporate action which allows SFTs to continue rolling. Yesterday someone finally posted the exact proof I needed to definitively say that it was processed incorrectly and that SFTs were NOT forced to close via NSCC Exit as they should have been.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/up2ub4anrqf91.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21829d801cb33f9356e65fa58bf70a56f7eb8e68

The only thing important in this entire page (yes, ignore the words that say Stock Split, they are noise) is the box that says ‚ÄúFC‚Äù. Specifically, it says FC 02. FC stands for Function Code 02, an NSCC processing code used for SFTs and other NSCC services. Let‚Äôs compare this to the supported actions list for SFT Clearing:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6zmpr34qrqf91.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0cac54f625df2a12d7281850f1cc24aa7c0dd72

Indeed, for the purposes of SFT financing, GME was processed as a Forward Stock Split (code 02) and thus considered a supported corporate action. As stated above, all other corporate actions, including a stock dividend, are unsupported and will require NSCC Exit of all SFTs. To be absolutely certain, lets make sure a stock dividend is indeed considered a separate corporate action by the NSCC and has a unique function code that is not included in the above table.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gr0s9a9srqf91.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4242f2b0f522468556e996c28b112b33bf82dc66

(Source: EVENTS tab of [https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/issues/Corporate-Actions-Transformation/2021/Corporate-Action-Announcements-Data-Dictionary-SR2021.xlsx](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/issues/Corporate-Actions-Transformation/2021/Corporate-Action-Announcements-Data-Dictionary-SR2021.xlsx))

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, indeed a Stock Dividend (FC-06) is considered a separate corporate action than a stock split (FC-02) by the NSCC/DTCC. As we don‚Äôt see code 06 in the previous table, a Stock Dividend is an unsupported corporate action.

&amp;#x200B;

By incorrectly processing the GME splividend as FC-02 (Forward Stock Split), the DTCC/NSCC have avoided the instant catastrophic failure that would come from an NSCC Exit of all outstanding SFTs for GME. I don‚Äôt know what the DTCC/NSCC leadership (looking at you Michael Bodson) was thinking, or if they were even aware, but I believe this is clear, documented evidence of fraud, including the specific mechanism by which the fraud occurred along with the relevant records, a direct material gain by the DTCC/NSCC, and financial damages to GME and GME stockholders and BOs. This seems to satisfy the three main elements of fraud:

* A material false statement made with an intent to deceive: The document stating that the GME corporate action was an FC-02 Stock Split which purports that GME is undergoing a corporate action which they did not announce (they specified the method of processing in their SEC filing to be a dividend: [https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/static-files/1764b8e4-0e1d-41a6-b502-8c5ab7604dc8](https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/static-files/1764b8e4-0e1d-41a6-b502-8c5ab7604dc8)). This has material impact as it determines whether SFTs must exit.
* A victim‚Äôs reliance on the statement: Brokers relied on the statement and issued subsequent misleading statements to their customers, and likely had incorrect bookkeeping due to accounting differences between a split and dividend.
* Damages: Regardless of how large or small, SFT closure would have resulted in some degree of buying pressure and thus price appreciation, even if the MO AS S thesis was wrong (which it is not). Thus, this fraud does not depend on convincing regulators or anyone of MO AS S. Additionally, IANAL so it probably isn‚Äôt a thing, but it could result in reputational damages for brokers which could cause them to lose customers and income.

# TA:DR

* Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs) are an alternative way to fulfill FTDs, short, and free up capital in the CNS.
* I presented a case for why I believe SFTs are one of, if not THE, main mechanism by which GME is being controlled and shorts have avoided delivery.
* Processing the splividend as a Forward Stock Split (FC-02) vs. a Stock Dividend (FC-06) is a critical distinction as all outstanding SFTs have to be closed in the event of FC-06 but not FC-02. We now have clear evidence that the splividend was processed as a Forward Stock Split (FC-02).
* I presented a case for why this qualifies as fraud.

&amp;#x200B;

# What happens from here?

I have absolutely no idea what comes next or what can be done about this. It would be very nice if GameStop and Loopring would hurry up and put us on a DEX but that is pure speculation and hope on my part. I wish the DOJ/FBI/SEC would do something but I have a feeling they are too busy watching porn. This seems to be clear fraud that would be a slam-dunk for the DOJ/FBI as the case wouldn‚Äôt require proving anything related to naked shorting, MO A SS, etc.

In my opinion, the single most important thing to do is DRS every single outstanding share and then some to finally end this. After seeing such blatant fraud I don't know why anyone would want to keep their shares in a broker (DTCC member).",Beyond the Wool ‚Äì The Smoking Gun and How the DTCC May Have Narrowly Avoided a Tactical Nuke (all credit to u/Daddy_Silverback),2022-08-05

I have to admit that lately there has been nice gains and loss porns but wouldn't be nice if we all post the plays before winning or getting wrecked?

It's nice to see good/bad outcome when people place bets but very few post their gamble before the porn. I strongly encourage all degenerates to post their positions even if you have no fucking clue of what you are doing. If you have a DD share it, if not just share your positions (as long as they follow the sub rules). For sub rules click on ""about"" and go through section #1.

wallstreetbets,"We need to build a simple wiki, with how-to guides and resources to assist the masses in joining the mission. This should be considered a critical objective among members of the community; there are many different levels of investing experience and understanding within the users here and we must work together to build the communication tools to present the information in a way that translates to all levels of understanding (from highly technical/graduate degree understanding down to ELI5). A guide that can spread beyond this community, or even beyond the internet, to help friends and family understand what is happening.  This information should then be screened for accuracy by as many experts as possible. It must be coherent and linear, and must allow people to understand the critical importance of holding real shares. 

I have been following GME loosely since the original spike last year. I‚Äôm relatively young and naive and way too online, inevitably day trading options became a hobby (addiction?).  I spend time in discord groups and on Twitter, listening and learning as much as I can but truthfully it‚Äôs mostly speculation. I scalped GME calls the day of the first spike and made a couple bucks but avoided it since. I didn‚Äôt understand. There are thousands of people lacking the fundamental understanding of what is going on, but they could easily join the rocket. The knowledge of GME has reached the youngest and oldest groups of culture, talked about by they/thems in Bushwick Brooklyn as well as in retirement communities in Texas. People bought in and trusted, but we need to prove this isn‚Äôt just hype. Twitter is still buying miladys, they could easily come around to this idea of real stock ownership if they understood the importance. I have spent a few hours trying to parse through all the knowledge here and have been convinced to buy 30 shares at open and will DRS them appropriately. I understand basic theory but the major issue with this moon mission is the noise and chaos of millions of apes pounding their chests screaming GME in every corner of the internet. It is easy to shrug it off as people on the internet being trolls or shills or mentally ill. We need to get this thing to critical mass, and that is by democratizing knowledge for the people.

I would happily volunteer to help organize this project, but I am unqualified to do it myself. Please contribute any thoughts on the matter. 

All the best

wallstreetbets,"INTZ Intrusion is a cybersecurity firm bringing a unique technology to market with 2 additional products being released in Q3. The firm has decade's old ties to the U.S. DOD. where their core technologies Savant and TraceCop were developed. They then recently developed a Zero Trust product called Shield , a hardware interface that sits behind a companies firewall and shuts down inbound and outbound traffic. This company has specific unique IP(intellectual property/patents/technology) that differentiate it from what other companies are doing. It is being marketed as a companion to current security systems not a rival. It gives added and more capable defense to pre-exsisting security suites. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7HZWGCwIxc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7HZWGCwIxc)  This is a video where the current CEO talks about the game plan and were the company is going.

But why should you care? Where are the bread crumbs? 

INTZ is a crappy little micro cap in Plano Texas. So why did the EX-CIO of Disney, Microsoft, VMware, who also happens to be the EX-CIO of the Federal Government under the Obama administration agree to be the CEO of an insignificantly small micro cap. Don't know the guy check out this [https://www.actiac.org/bio/tony-scott-1](https://www.actiac.org/bio/tony-scott-1). 

Smart money gets in first and they have. Look at the institutions that have a piece of this thing. Go do your due diligence and look at it. Then look at the chart and ask why no one is selling down anymore. Ask why? Volume on the buyside has been light because its unproven as of yet. Today is the earnings release after hours. Look at their recent news releases. Watch that video. Their was a good article on Seeking Alpha written in June from the same group that did that youtube video above.

I think this thing is going to be huge. I think its going to get there fast. 

The new products rolling out in Q3 are Shield Cloud and Endpoint. You need to check this out. Headwinds should be behind the company with the exception of the limiting factors of recessionary spending. I'm long-term Long this one.

 I am only 20 years old and I have never dabbled in investments before. I don't really understand how it works other than graph go down, buy, graph go up = more money. My main goal really is to find myself another avenue to rely on financially other than the shitty job I work in right now. And thankfully, I still have money left over after paying my bills that I have no use for other than letting it sit in my bank account.   


I am not here to make millions. I just hope to make a little bit of money on the side at least until I start understanding how to invest more comfortably.

Today we  talk about the CircleDNA

In February 2019, Berry Genenomics, a leading domestic genetic testing enterprise, and Prenetics limited invested in the establishment of ""circle DNA"" to complete the establishment of the main management team. Yan Jun, the former general manager of Google China strategic cooperation, served as CEO.

Berry gene said in its 2018 annual report that investing in CircleDNA is ""a strategic layout for the company to try to enter the field of consumer gene testing and realize the reasonable extension of the gene testing industry chain to the downstream"".

On June 26, 2018, 23 Rubik's cube released a price reduction announcement, and a genetic test was reduced from 499 yuan to 299 yuan. These two events can be regarded as two driving factors for the development of DTC gene detection: application scenario and price.

At present, the brands of consumer gene testing in China include 23 Rubik's cube, Wegene,Micro gene, Anwo gene, Colorful DNA, Jellyfish Gene, Jiujiu gene,CircleDNA and Genetreasure. Among them, 23 Rubik's cube has completed round C financing. Wegene micro gene obtained round B financing. Domestic gene testing companies mainly engaged in clinical and scientific research include berry gene, Daan gene, Dean diagnostics, Jinyu medicine, etc. Berry gene has a market value of 13.493 billion yuan and a net profit of 313 million yuan in Q3, a year-on-year increase of 30.96%.",The origin of CircleDNA,2022-08-04
