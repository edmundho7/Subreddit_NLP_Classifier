stocks,"So I am complete noob at stocks. I have some knowledge but not enough. So I need a bit of help from the community.

I acquired APE coin at 23.87 before it plummeted. Me thinking it was going to the moon. So after the big issue with BAYC/ The Otherside it went to shit.

Now APE coin is at 7.26. Which sucks for me and others who bought in and didn‚Äôt sell out at a right time.

I‚Äôm pretty much stuck with this crap and screwed if I sell. ‚ÄúIts not a loss if you don‚Äôt sell‚Äù. Been stuck for a while.

So what could I do to sell to recuperate my losses or at least not lose as much.

What I have in mind is to wait for a drop in APE coin to buy in more averaging my total coin. Then when it bumps up sell.

I could lose a bit but at least not all of it.

Shit has been pretty hectic these days and I need money to pay my dues. Feels like this ship is sinking and need all the help I can get.

Id really appreciate the help!

stocks,"Name: Monster Beverage Corp
Ticker: MNST 
Price: $91.38
Sector: Consumer Staples 
P/E: 36.09

Monster Beverage Corp is a company that makes &amp; sells energy drinks. Their flagship brand is Monster Energy, accounting for 95% of their sales. Monster Beverage was founded in 1935, although the company only started selling the Monster Energy brand in 2002 and in 2012 changed their name from Hansen's to Monster Energy. In 2015 the company sold off its Hansen's juices to Coca-Cola. The largest share holder of Monster Beverage Corp is Coca-Cola, at a 19.3% stake in the company. In 2014, Coca-Cola and Monster Beverage formed an agreement for Coca-Cola to become Monster's preferred distribution partner and Monster to become Coca-Cola's sole play in the energy drinks market.

Monster has expanded their list of energy drink brands to include:
Monster Energy 
Reign
Predator
Relentless
Mother
Burn
NOS
Full Throttle

The recent acquisition of CANarchy, the craft beer and hard seltzer company will add Oskar Blues, Cigar City Brewing, Squatters, Wasatch, Deep Ellum brewing company , &amp; Perrin Brewing Company brands to Monster Beverage.
CANarchy is a top 5 US craft brewery with 7 factories and 566 employees. The CANarchy acquisition marks Monster's planned expansion into the alcoholic beverages market.

Meanwhile in the energy drinks industry Monster and Redbull are the leading energy drink brands by far, with Redbull slightly edging Monster to the #1 spot in the US. If you counted all of Monster's brands then Monster would be the leading energy drink company in the United States. Meanwhile in Europe Redbull has the advantage, although Monster is catching up fast, as shown by its 15.39% Revenue CAGR over the last 5 years. 

Monster's management is supreme, with the founders (Rodney Sacks &amp; Hilton Schlosberg) of Monster Energy still at the helm today, so we can be assured that Monster's future is in safe hands. The founders own a combined total of 18% of the company so they have tons of incentives to lead Monster well.

Monster retains a ROIC of over 20% most years, and with a strong balance sheet, I do not see this company seeing any trouble in the near future.

The P/E of 36 isn't making me a big fan of $MNST's price right now, but i am a fan of the business and I will buy in when it falls. 

Through all this I have concluded that the business is great but the price is putting me off - I have lots of time to wait for a better entry point as the moat of Monster won't get eroded easily. As Charlie Munger says, ""The big money isn't made in the buying or selling, it's made in the waiting"" - and that's exactly what I plan to do with Monster Beverage Corp.

stocks,"  Google (Or Alphabet inc) is a 1.5T market cap company - But I still see growth ahead of it. Here's my DD.

We all know what Google‚Äôs main business is (Google Search), so here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of the alternate revenue sources for Q2 2022:

Search - $39.6B

Cloud - $5.8B

Youtube - $6.9B

Network - $8.2B

Other - $6.8B

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, Google search contributes to over half of Google‚Äôs revenue, but revenues from Youtube, Network &amp; Cloud are not insignificant either. Google isn‚Äôt falling behind the competition either, using nearly $10B on R&amp;D per quarter. Google search has a massive moat, and as more of the world are getting online, I can not see Google‚Äôs search revenue declining. On the other hand, Youtube is eating up more streaming viewers from twitch, while Tiktok poses tough competition in the Youtube ‚Äòshorts‚Äô section. I still believe Youtube to be the premium video content platform. Google cloud has a roughly 10% market share in a fast-growing industry, expected to be worth roughly $83B at the end of 2022. Cloud is the third largest player in this sector, behind AWS (33%) and Azure (22%). Google is constantly innovating to keep its market share, and the moat is not eroding. Because of this, I believe Google is a wonderful business trading at a discount due to market conditions - Here is my estimation of Google‚Äôs fair value:

TTM FCF 65.19B

Assumptions 

3% FCF growth 

8% Discount rate 

2% Terminal growth rate 

10 years of projection

$184.92 Fair Value 

$116.93 Price

38% Discount on Fair Value 

\*Always do your own calculations of fair value, I am not a financial advisor\*

While the P/E (21.3) &amp; P/B (6.0) may be high, making Google not a traditional ‚ÄòValue‚Äô Investment, I feel it is fair to pay a small premium for a wonderful business, AKA a fair price for a wonderful business, as opposed to a wonderful price for a fair business. 

For me Google is a long-term hold, as the management team has shown their competence, and I have high conviction in the performance of their products, as well as the business as a whole.

Google is also using cash flow in acquisitions, such as buying Mandiant for $5.4B, a cyber security company, as well as buying FitBit for $2.1B, a smartwatch company to further enhance the google suite of products. Fitbit is the 4th biggest company by market share in the wearables industry.

Here are the revenue &amp; earnings growth for the last 5 years: 

Revenue:

2016 ‚Äì 90.27B

2017 ‚Äì 110.85B 

2018 ‚Äì 136.82B 

2019 ‚Äì 161.86B

2020 ‚Äì 182.53B

2021 ‚Äì 257.64B 

5 year Revenue CAGR: 23.7% 

Earnings Per Share:

2016 ‚Äì 1.39

2017 ‚Äì 0.90

2018 ‚Äì 2.19

2019 ‚Äì 2.46 

2020 ‚Äì 2.93 

2021 ‚Äì 5.61 

5 Year EPS CAGR: 46.1% 

Google, a 1.54T market cap company, is still growing at 20%+ per year ‚Äì that is insane. 

I firmly believe Google to be a wonderful business, with a lot of growth ahead of it.

Gamestop has made a public announcement addressing the on going chaos from the 4 for 1 stock split via dividend it issued.

Many international shareholders(Germany, Korean, Canadian, etc) have documented their brokerages were told by the DTC to do a regular forward split and not a split via dividend.

Gamestop and their transfer agent Computershare have confirmed the appropriate allotment of new dividend shares were given out GS -&gt; CS -&gt; DTC -&gt; Brokerages 

But it appears the DTC kept the shares they were provided for themselves and intentionally misled brokers, thereby making them liable for millions of shares at a time when 50%+ of Gamestops free float has been locked up by Direct Registration and liquidity is bone dry

Tesla‚Äôs Cybertruck, that object of intense fascination and ridicule that may or may not go into production next year, was supposed to start at the extremely attractive price of $39,900. But that was back in 2019 when the Cybertruck was first announced, and as Tesla CEO Elon Musk put it recently, ‚Äúa lot has changed‚Äù since then.

Speaking at his company‚Äôs annual shareholder meeting, Musk said that the Cybertruck‚Äôs specs and price ‚Äúwill be different,‚Äù citing inflation and other ‚Äúvarious issues‚Äù that have cropped up in the three years since the electric truck was first unveiled.

 

‚ÄúI hate to give a little bit of bad news,‚Äù he added, before going on to hype the Cybertruck as ‚Äúone hell of a product‚Äù and a ‚Äúdamn fine machine.‚Äù

Musk said that the Cybertruck would be in volume production by ‚Äúthe middle of next year‚Äù ‚Äî but of course, that has been a shifting target, too. Production was originally supposed to start in late 2021. But by August 2021, [the company announced](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk) a delay until 2022 ‚Äî and then later to ‚Äúhopefully‚Äù 2023. In the meantime, competitors like [Ford](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/27/23144346/ford-delivers-first-f150-lightning-electric-truck-chevy-tesla) and [Rivian](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23067212/rivian-earnings-q1-2022-electric-truck-deliveries-stock) have launched their own electric pickups, with Ford saying that it plans to make [150,000 F-150 Lightnings](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865664/ford-f150-lightning-double-production-150000-annual) by 2023.

 

 

* Musk didn‚Äôt divulge any details beyond noting that the original price would not be the same. In 2019, Tesla said it would make three versions of the Cybertruck:
* Single motor rear-wheel drive with 250 miles of range, 7,500-pound towing capacity, and zero to 60mph capabilities in under 6.5 seconds for $39,900
* Dual motor all-wheel drive with 300 miles of range, 10,000-pound towing capacity, and zero to 60mph in under 4.5 seconds for $49,900
* Triple motor all-wheel drive with 500 miles of range, 14,000-pound towing capacity, and zero to 60mph in under 2.9 seconds for $69,900.

Is Tesla still set on making those three versions? Who knows? Will it actually go into production in the middle of 2023? ‚ÄúReply hazy, try again.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Another unanswered question is the number of reservations Tesla currently has on file. The last number reported ‚Äî 650,000 ‚Äî was from June 2020, but assumedly it has grown since then. A crowdsourced Cybertruck reservation tally by the Cybertruck forum with over 28,000 entries put [reservations at over 1 million](https://electrek.co/2021/05/25/tesla-cybertruck-reservations-1-million-electric-pickup-trucks/) back in May 2021, [according to *Electrek*](https://electrek.co/2022/05/16/tesla-cybertruck-reservations-only-north-america/). The number has kept growing over the last year, and it is now estimated to be close to 1.5 million reservations.

Meanwhile, Tesla has recently [raised prices](https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/16/23170714/tesla-price-increase-june-2022-model-3-y-s) (again) for its non-vaporware lineup of EVs ‚Äî except for the Model 3. And the company caught a bit of good news when it was revealed that the new climate deal put forward by Senate Democrats, if passed, would eliminate the cap of 200,000 vehicles sold to trigger a phaseout of the $7,500 tax credit. Tesla was the first automaker to sell 200,000 EVs, triggering the phaseout back in 2018.

But the legislation would restrict eligibility for the credits to EVs priced no higher than $55,000 for new cars and $80,000 for pickups and SUVs ‚Äî which means Tesla will need to price the Cybertruck accordingly if it‚Äôs to be eligible.

stocks,"# California regulators aim to revoke Tesla's ability to sell cars in the state over the company's marketing of its 'Full Self-Driving' technology

&amp;#x200B;

* **California DMV regulators accused Tesla of deceptive marketing over its driver assistance systems.**
* **Tesla's ""Full Self-Driving Capability"" does not operate as claimed, according to the complaint.** 
* **Penalties may include suspension or revocation of the company's license to sell cars in the state.**

&amp;#x200B;

Regulators with the California Department of Motor Vehicles are targeting Tesla's license to sell cars in the state after accusing the company of deceptive business practices over its marketing of what it calls its ""Full Self-Driving Capability.""¬†

Tesla's marketing claims the cars function with ""autopilot"" or ""Full Self-Driving"" capabilities ‚Äî for a $12,000 pricetag ‚Äî suggested that the vehicles operate autonomously, according to the [complaints](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22127992-585743318-california-dmv-accusation-against-tesla-inc-vehicle-manufacturer?responsive=1&amp;title=1) [filed](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22127991-585743312-california-dmv-accusation-against-tesla-inc-vehicle-dealer?responsive=1&amp;title=1) July 28.¬†

""All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go,"" one Tesla advertisement cited in the complaint read. ""If you don't say anything, your car will look at your calendar and take you there as the assumed destination. Your Tesla will figure out the optimal route, navigating urban steets, complex intersections and freeways. To your Destination - When you arrive at your destination, simply step out at the entrance and your car will enter park seek mode, automatically search for a spot and park itself. A tap on your phone summons it back to you.""¬†

But, because the company's vehicles ""could not at the time of those advertisements, and cannot now"" operate without a driver, the marketing violates California law about advertisements using untrue claims to market their products, according to the complaints.¬†

""Respondent made or disseminated statements that are untrue or misleading, and not based on facts, in advertising vehicles as equipped, or potentially equipped, with advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) features,"" the pair of complaints against Tesla's [dealership](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22127991-585743312-california-dmv-accusation-against-tesla-inc-vehicle-dealer?responsive=1&amp;title=1)¬†and [manufacturing](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22127992-585743318-california-dmv-accusation-against-tesla-inc-vehicle-manufacturer?responsive=1&amp;title=1) divisions read.¬†

The penalty for the violations may include suspension or revocation of the company's license to sell cars in the state, as well as paying restitution to customers who were deceived by the marketing, according to the complaint.¬†¬†

""The undersigned prays that the Departrnent of Motor Vehicles take such action against the license of the Respondent as is warranted by the facts of this case,"" the complaint, signed by regulator Ailene Short, the chief of the industry services branch of the DMV's occupational licensing division, read.¬†

Elon Musk said in a June interview that creating reliable self-driving technology is [""essential"" to the financial success of the company](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-worth-basically-zero-without-self-driving-2022-6).

""\[T\]he overwhelming focus is on solving full self-driving,"" Musk said in an interview¬†with the YouTube channel ""Tesla Owners Silicon Valley,"" published Tuesday.¬†""That's essential. It's really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.""

But the billionaire has been making big promises about self-driving features for years, despite [customer complaints](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/regulators-looking-complaint-teslas-full-self-driving-software-rcna5537),¬† and the fact that [Teslas accounted for 273 of nearly 400 US crashes](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/15/tesla-us-car-carashes-driver-assist-systems) involving driver-assist systems in the last year.

[In 2019](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-doubles-down-on-claim-about-self-driving-tech-2019-2), Musk said he was ""certain"" that by the end of that year, Teslas ""will be able to find you in a parking lot, pick you up, take you all the way to your destination without an intervention.""

Representatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.¬†

My question is, if you guys were 3-5 years out roughly from buying a house, but wanted to park the money you're going to use as a down payment somewhere for short term growth , where are you putting it and why. Up until now I've honestly been thinking about going 50% AAPL &amp; 50% VOO.

I'll also add that for what ever reason, when I'm depositing money into a brokerage account, making it less accessible and buying stocks, I seem to be able to stay more disciplined with saving it, not touching it. I used this method when buying my current house, adding to the equity of my first. However Ill admit it was during the bull run, and I'm well aware there was luck involved.

stocks,"Since inception (60 + years, almost 100 years if you cont the early days aswell) the S&amp;P 500 has had an average return of about 10%. S&amp;P 500 tracking ETFs have become the most mainstream investing method and many investors are betting the majority of their life savings that  S&amp;P 500 will keep going up.

Why are people not investing in a triple leveraged S&amp;P 500 ETF like UPRO if we are so sure S&amp;P will keep going up. Or perhaps a 2x leveraged like SSO with even lower expenses.

The downsides i see:

The expense ratio, but it is only at 0.91%, the actual benefit of getting over the double return of  S&amp;P outweigh the actual expenses by a landslide.

The only other problem i see is the perceived risk, it crashes way harder than the S&amp;P but it also recovers way harder, so if you just stay true to your prinicpals as if it was the actual S&amp;P and dont let emotions influence decision, then you would stille benefit way more.

&gt; GameStop Guidance for International Stockholders with Split-Related Questions   

&gt; GameStop has notified its transfer agent and the Depository Trust Company (‚ÄúDTC‚Äù) that some of our valued stockholders in international geographies are still trying to determine if they have received the proper stock dividend associated with the Company‚Äôs recent 4-for-1 stock split. Please note GameStop has already distributed the shares of common stock required for the stock dividend to its transfer agent, which has confirmed it subsequently distributed the appropriate number of shares of common stock to DTC for allocation to brokerage firms and other participants. We recommend that stockholders using a brokerage firm contact that firm with needs or questions. Stockholders may want to make their brokerage firm aware if they recently moved shares to the Company‚Äôs direct registered list, as we have been informed this move could impact a firm‚Äôs distribution of shares.  

&gt; As always, we appreciate your investment and enthusiasm. Although we are not able to engage with individual brokerage firms, we are monitoring this situation and will keep you informed of any relevant updates we obtain through our transfer agent or DTC.

Apparently, the DTC has advised international brokers to consider GameStop's stock split as a regular split, not a split via dividend. According to GameStop's statement, they issued the correct number of shares for the stock dividend to its transfer agent who then distributed the correct number of shares to the DTC to be allocated to other firms. 

Seems clear as day that the DTC doesn't have enough shares to distribute to all GME shareholders. I think that's because of the thesis surrounding GME of having a ludicrous amount of synthetic shares. DTC is making these international brokers do a regular split as a result. This is kind of a big deal is it not?

# **S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq fall Friday, but notch weekly gains after blowout July jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/04/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks wavered Friday in a volatile trading session after the July jobs report was much better than expected, as investors assessed what a strong labor market would mean for the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate tightening campaign.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 76.65 points, or 0.23%, to end at 32,803.47. Even with Friday‚Äôs gains, however, it fell on the week. The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.16% to end at 4,145.19, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.50% Friday, falling to 12,657.56. Still, both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the first week of August higher.
*****
&gt; Losses were offset by bank stocks, which rose on hopes that interest rate hikes will continue at a solid clip. Energy stocks also gained, but technology companies slumped.
*****
&gt; The labor market added 528,000 jobs in July, easily beating a Dow Jones estimate of a 258,000 increase. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5%, below the 3.6% estimate. Wage growth also rose more than estimated, up 0.5% for the month and 5.2% higher than a year ago, signaling that high inflation is likely still a problem.
*****
&gt; Stocks opened lower following the report, even as it seemed to indicate the economy was not currently in a recession. Job growth was expected to slow as the Fed continues to hike interest rates to tame inflation, but this report shows a labor market still running hot. That means the central bank may act more aggressively at its next meeting.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúAnybody that jumped on the ‚ÄòFed is going to pivot next year and start cutting rates‚Äô is going to have to get off at the next station, because that‚Äôs not in the cards,‚Äù said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. ‚ÄúIt is clearly a situation where the economy is not screeching or heading into a recession here and now.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Friday‚Äôs jobs report is a crucial one as it‚Äôs one of two the central bank will see before it decides how much to raise rates at its September meeting. Indeed, traders are already betting on a tougher stance from the Fed. Policy makers will have another jobs report and two more consumer price index numbers to weigh before the central bank makes its next rate decision.
*****
&gt; Major averages posted their best month since 2020 in July on the hope the Fed would slow the pace of its hikes. The S&amp;P 500 added 9.1% last month.

&gt; # Crazy Moves in the Bond Market

&gt; The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) declined over 2% on Friday, which for a sector of the financial universe that is known for its safety, is a relatively rare occurrence. Since the ETF's launch in 2002, only 3.1% of all trading days have been gains or losses of at least 2%. Not only was Friday a big move for TLT, but it was also the third day this week that the ETF was up or down 2% on the trading day. Talk about an uncertain environment! With investors looking to forecast the path and intensity of rate hikes against a backdrop of high inflation, stronger than expected economic data (like Friday's Payroll report) puts upward pressure on yields, while weaker than expected data suggests the economy is cooling off causing bonds to rally and yields to fall.

&gt; As mentioned above, three of the last five trading days have seen daily moves of plus or minus 2%. Only two other periods throughout the history of TLT have seen a higher rate of 2%+ moves in TLT, those being August of 2011 and March of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/TLT-rolling-5-day-moves-2-pct-plus-080522.png))**

&gt; Since TLT was launched in 2002, there have only been 22 trading days in which the ETF had moved 2%+ three times over a trailing five-day period. Those occurrences are shown on the chart below and they are clustered around three different periods - the Financial Crisis, the US debt downgrade in 2011, and the COVID crash. Needless to say, these were all very tumultuous periods in the markets and economy.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/TLT-2-pct-plus-moves-080522.png))**

&gt; Interestingly, there have been seven years since 2002 in which TLT has had less 2%+ percent daily moves than we have had in the last five days! For the entire year, this week's three occurrences take the total number of 2% daily moves for TLT to 17. There are still five months left in 2022, but if there wasn't another day with a gain or loss of 2%, this year would still rank fourth in terms of total 2%+ moves. Not only that, but if this year's pace were to continue, it would put 2022 on track for a record twenty-nine 2% moves, surpassing the prior record of 22 from 2011.

&gt; The game is on as the market awaits tomorrow‚Äôs employment report and to see if the other shoe is going to drop on layoffs. Not to mention any deeper impact on the economy from inflation and the prospect of more aggressive rate increases from the Fed.

&gt; We are taking the excitement over the renewed bullish sentiment with a grain of salt. There was a similar rise in bullish sentiment at the end March as that rally stalled just before the bottom fell out.

&gt; Investors Intelligence Bulls/Bears Difference also rallied back above zero in late-March as it has the last few weeks. Red circles in the chart show comparable moves above zero during the 2008-2009 and 2015-2016 bears well before those bottoms.

&gt; We may yet push a bit higher, but our cycles and indicators are still pointing to a retest of the June lows with the potential for a lower low before the bottom over the next three months.

***** 

&gt; # Bulls Back Above 30%

&gt; While the rally has paused today, the S&amp;P 500 has continued to press higher in the past week and is currently hovering near resistance at the late May/early June highs. In response to those moves, investor sentiment has improved with the weekly survey from the AAII showing over 30% of respondents reporting as bullish. That is the highest reading since the first week of June when the S&amp;P 500 was at similar levels to now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment is a similar story in hitting the lowest level since the first week of June as it has fallen back below 40%. The further 1.2 percentage point drop marks the fourth week in a row that bearish sentiment has fallen, and the full decline since the recent high of 59.3% on June 23rd now sits at over 20 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; In spite of those further improvements, there continues to be more bears than bulls as the spread remains in negative territory. As shown in the second chart below, the bull bear spread has now been negative for 18 weeks in a row.

&gt; # Strongest July in Post-WWII Era

&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 closed over 140 basis points higher on the back of favorable earnings from Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Chevron (CVX) and Exxon (XOM). This was the third straight day in which the S&amp;P 500 gained at least one percent, allowing bulls to breathe a sigh of relief after a tough start to the year. These moves came even as a second consecutive quarter of negative real GDP growth was reported and the Fed hikes rates by 75 basis points.

&gt; Friday's move helped the S&amp;P 500 post its best July in the post-WWII era, finishing with a gain of 9.2%. Although the index is still close to 14% off of its early January highs, the market looks more inviting than it did at the beginning of the month, when the YTD declines were above 20%. As investors, we could just give ourselves high fives for the month, but it's vital to remain forward-looking. Following July gains of 5%+, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.6% in August (median: +1.4%), performing positively 60 percent of the time. Between the start of August and the end of the calendar year, the index has averaged a gain of 8.0% (median: +10.0%), gaining 80% of the time. Over the following twelve months (starting in August), the index has averaged an impressive gain of 15.6% (median: +15.4%), rallying 87% of the time. Based on past history, bull runs in July tend to bode well for the market for both the rest of the year and over the following twelve months.

&gt; # Rotating in August

&gt; Following the best July of the post-WWII era, equities have been getting off to a slower start in August with the Russell 3,000 experiencing a modest decline yesterday and the index fighting to move into the green as of midday today. Most of the move to start August appears to a degree to be rotational in nature. In the chart below, we show the average performance of deciles of Russell 3,000 stocks grouped by their performance in the month of July. As shown, both the best and worst performers last month have rallied in early August with the deciles of the worst performers seeing slightly larger gains. The losers this month have been in the middle of the performance spectrum as deciles 4 through 7 are each flat to lower over the past couple of sessions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080222-Deciles-2.png))**

&gt; Equities bottomed in mid-June and have been in rally mode ever since. As for how performance the past couple of days relates to the first half of the year's declines, again the worst performers have generally been outperforming. However, by this measure, the top performers from the 52-week high just after the New Year through the low in June have continued to fall this week.

&gt; Inflation, war, recession fears, aggressive Fed rate hikes, lingering supply chain issues, layoffs, earnings misses, and lingering pandemic issues drove the market into official bear market territory last month.

&gt; Driven by hopes of a soft landing, a resilient labor market, pockets of positive economic and corporate results, and some rather seriously oversold conditions in big name tech and growth stocks the market has rallied smartly off the June lows.

&gt; At the end of July DJIA was up 9.9% from the June lows, S&amp;P up 12.6% and NASDAQ up 16.4. Summer rally 2022 has worked the bulls into a frenzy like a matador with his red muleta. DJIA logged its 7th best July since 1950, up 6.7%, qualifying as a ‚ÄúHot July Market.‚Äù

&gt; Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of 7.2% on average in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year.

&gt; # Initial Claims Back to the Highs

&gt; Initial jobless claims came in matching expectations at 260K this week, up from last week's downward revision of 254K. That reading leaves claims 1K below the pandemic high set two weeks ago. Those levels are above the pre-pandemic range and consistent with where claims stood in the fall of 2017.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims have the benefit of seasonal tailwinds at this point of the year as the mid-summer peak works itself out. Given this, unadjusted claims have dropped to 205.6K from the high of 258.9K two weeks ago. Although that is a strong level of claims, it is above the readings from the comparable week of the year in 2018 and 2019.

&gt; Continuing claims are lagged an additional week to the initial claims number meaning the most recent reading is as of the week of July 22nd. Although initial claims had fallen that week, continuing claims moved back above 1.4 million for the first time since mid-April. Unlike initial claims, and as we will discuss further in tonight's Closer, the deterioration in continuing claims has been relatively modest as current levels are not only well below levels from the two years pre-pandemic, but this week's reading would still make for some of the best readings since 1970.

Luxury car companies known for their solid operating margins and gross profits are solid steps below Tesla now.

* Operates in the high-growth potential digital payments/banking industry where cash is still used in the majority of consumer transactions.
* Very innovative and is using financial technology to empower micro to medium sized businesses.
* Has almost doubled revenue from around $1.12B to $2.22B between March '20 and March '22.
* Has maintained profitability (unlike it's closest competitor $STNE).
* Grown earnings at an average of 22% per year over the past 5 years. (Although earnings have decreased marginally over past 2 years as profit margins have weakened)
* Analysts forecast earnings to grow by 24% per year and revenue by 18% per year over the next 3 years.
* P/E of 21 and P/S of 2.2, which is not cheap but not overvalued considering high growth expectations.
* Healthy balance sheet with net assets of $2.1B and low levels of debt relative to their cash position and cash flow.

I don't love the idea of owning European and Emerging market stocks. I don't understand their economies, their politics, or their companies. As a Canadian, I'm much more comfortable investing in Canada and the US, mainly because I understand them, and also because the companies in NA are already global, so it's more than enough diversification in my mind.

stocks,"From my personal experience as a Facebook and Instagram user for over 10 years; the experience has become more and more mundane every year, exponentially. I see the same pattern among most of my peers; everyone posts less and less or nothing at all anymore. Whenever you engage and comment on a public post/page/group that you follow, Facebook will blast it to all of your friends' feeds including people on your friends who you really don't care for or barely know like a former co-worker or someone you met briefly at a networking event 5 years ago. Nobody wants to share that with everyone. This is why posting and engagement is vanishing. Instagram has a similar version of this idiotic setup where the scroll will show your friends content that you liked or commented on and highlight your profile name, so there goes engaging on a controversial post or simping on a fitness influencer (which is probably a huge driver of engagement on Instagram). The point is that the disregard for privacy is also a disregard for a good-quality user experience.  It actually discourages engagement. 

On both facebook and Instagram, business profiles are ghost towns even if you waste some money on ads for *additional* exposure. This is exacerbated for small businesses which largely outnumber large businesses.

While facebook may have replaced myspace, it never accommodated an adequate space for bands/musicians. The amount of engagement that can be created between artists and fans has completely been neglected and abandoned by the platform. 

The facebook marketplace is an absolute frustration for both buyers and sellers. 

Facebook groups have become safe heavens for scammers because no matter how many times you report them and the nigerian admins pretending to be sweet old ladies from the midwest selling puppies, and facebook's automated reporting system will tell you that they found nothing wrong that violated the community guidelines. Meanwhile, actual sweet old ladies keep getting scammed and sending deposits for puppies that don't exist. It doesn't matter how many times you report the group or the fake profiles, facebook's automated system says it's all good. When the scammer's group finally gets too much heat or finally gets shut down, they simply start new fake profiles and a new group in an hour, and it's rinse and repeat all over again. 

Facebook Watch is nowhere near as practical as Youtube, and the algorithm pushes the most toxic content possible for the sake of clickbait and engagement. You start by watching a sports clip or a video of a cute dog posted by a page that you actually follow, and the algorithm will immediately start playing an infinite auto-scroll of car crashes, fights, burglaries, and other violent/toxic content. Comment on any of those videos posted by pages that you don't follow, and all your friends will see your outburst or your stance on a controversial topic. 

Instagram has completely abandoned its original purpose to become a hybrid of snapchat and tiktok. You can say that social media is ever-evolfing and fluid, but the most egregious aspect of this is that Instagram does not support content creators. Without content creators, there is no Instagram! Instead, Instagram rewards spammers and content thieves that lift popular content from original creators and compile it under soulless pages that the algorithm reward with all the exposure. Seriously, go into the explore tab and start scrolling through reels and take note of how many of those are from either content creators or content thieves. 

Have you seen the profile page for facebook on Instagram? This is how delusional the company is. It completely ignores and underrepresents the core of the facebook userbase. Do you think that most of the poeple that actually use facebook are the cool kind of people shown in that facebook profile on instagram? They are actually the kind of people that use facebook the least, if they even have a facebook profile.  

When facebook started, it had a clear vision to connect college students. Expanding beyond college students was reasonable and welcomed, it made sense to grow beyond that, but where is it heading now? Where has it been heading for the past 7 years? It seems like it's way off course and without a direction, just drifting away. What's the point of trying to be a generic one-size-fits-all version of snapchat, tiktok, youtube, craigslist, tinder, instagram, discord, myspace, zoom, periscope, etc.

Sens recently got insurance approval from anthem adding 45 million people that can now access Eversense CGM under insurance. This company has continually survived through hell and back with covid and then this recent recession and battling for FDA approval in the past. This company imo has shown exceptional management to survive and overcome these obstacles. Not only this but the technology is there and the product is there. This is the most accurate CGM out to date in terms of calculating blood sugar to the highest accuracy (yes better than dexcom). The way I look at it is this, this company currently has captured less than 1% of the diabetic market in the US. If they continue to grow and innovate there should be no reason why they don't capture more market share. Another interesting comparison to note is Dexcom's price per share back in the 08 recession got as low at $0.38 in Nov of 2008. Sens also had similar lows during covid and recently came back down into the $0.80 range before more than doubling recently on this news. I think even at $2 a share this company is a buy and will be a nice hold for the future. Their product pipeline is looking impeccable and they can eventually branch out laterally in the healthcare industry and make attempts at monitoring other variables other than glucose like blood chemistry variables or really any other blood component. I think the future can be very bright for a company like this. If we capitulate further and this recession does get worse keep this on the radar as a long term hold.","Sens covered under anthem insurance, what this could entail for future capture of diabetic market share",2022-08-05

If the monkey pox outbreak warrants the company can produce up to 500,000 courses a year with the current capacity.
In pill form, the drug is taken over a period of two weeks and this is a course. 
The price for each course for international customers Is $900-$1000 per course. 
In the US it is $300-$400. 
Pricing differs depending on the size of the order. 
Should  the company deliver 500,000 courses in a single year it‚Äôs revenue from Tecovirimat would be  $500 million in that year.

stocks,"Company: CyberOptics Corporation 

Ticker: NASDAQ:CYBE 

Market Cap: $296M

Price per share (8/4/22): $40.50

CyberOptics (NASDAQ:CYBE) is an excellent picks and shovels play on the continued growth of the semiconductor industry. The chip shortage that is still ongoing shed a light on major supply chain issues and accelerated developments like the passing of the US CHIPS Act, which includes $52 billion in subsidies to encourage chip manufacturers to build out semiconductor fabrication plants in the US. A major catalyst for the stock price could be Mr Market waking up to the Apple mini-LED connection. The important point to keep in mind is that there is additional growth coming later 2022/early 2023 that Mr market is not expecting.

Other catalysts are earnings growth, multiple expansion and big order announcements for WaferSense.

To sum up,

* **Hidden champion in sensor &amp; inspection technology**
* **Picks and shovels play on the semiconductor industry**
* **Own near 100% market share of wireless real time wafer sensors**
* **CHIPS Act and EU chip act beneficiary**
* **Apple mini-LED revenue expected in Q4 2022**
* **Chart points at breakout above 22 year high** 
* **Growing faster than its industry**
* **Attractive valuation**
* **FWD EPS Diluted Growth + 46.88 %**
* **Multi bagger potential**

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

**Pinelawn Cemetery (PLWN):** the company owns a 500-acre cemetery on Long Island, which has its own commuter rail stop. It still has a lot of unsold plots, the plot sales price is tied to inflation, and it pays a 9.1% dividend.

I would probably buy a couple of shares of it if I could, but it's inaccessible to most investors. There was a ProPublica piece on the company last month:

[https://www.propublica.org/article/cemetery-long-island-pinelawn-lockes-pinelawn](https://www.propublica.org/article/cemetery-long-island-pinelawn-lockes-pinelawn)

**Giant Group (GGLT):** a Beverly Hills-based nanocap that's led by Burt Sugarman, the Warren Buffett of '70s variety shows. He's been the CEO for 30 or 40 years. 

Its only activity seems to be its 8% ownership of Checkers and Rally's stock. It might also own a cement company, but it's hard to tell, because it hasn't filed a 10-K since 2004. 

**Buck Hill Falls (BUHF):** Buying this stock is sort of like buying an HOA membership without actually living there. The company owns a planned community in rural Pennsylvania, and spends all of its profits on maintaining the golf course, etc. It's possibly never paid a dividend in the entire time it's been in existence, which is over a century. 

The best-case scenario for a shareholder (or at least a non-resident shareholder) would be the sale of the community to another company. But that might not happen in the next hundred years.",What do you think is the strangest stock?,2022-08-05

stocks,"As someone who has been working in ASML's supply chain for a couple of years, and has positioned his little savings heavily in favor of the lithography and the chip industry in general, I can't help but watch the China chip news closely. Just like everyone else, I am apprehensive about the development of the China-Taiwan relationship, and the possibility of another war unfolding upon us. There is no doubt that if there should be a war, the whole world will suffer.

However, while everyone is anxiously thinking about a possible war in Taiwan and catastrophic effects on TSMC, no one seems to be really aware of other ways that China can affect the lithography industry. At the moment of writing this post, ASML is basically a monopoly in advanced lithography and EUV, and chances are that they will stay that way for the following decade. However sadly, ASML's entire development environment is based on Siemens Digital Industries Software, namely CAD software NX and PDM/PLM software Teamcenter. Both software are proprietary, meaning ASML has no clue what the content of their files and documents is. In practice, SIEMENS owns all the advanced technologies that ASML has developed or is developing.

ASML decision makers, who I believe to be among the smartest people in the world, seem to be blind to this huge vulnerability. They do not seem to understand that they do not own their information when they are locking their entire existence in one single company's ecosystem. They keep working with SIEMENS because simply they have been using their products for decades. 

Just imagine that one of China's completion companies (e.g., Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation SMIC) acquires this SIEMENS branch, or buys a majority of the shares. I would like to know your opinion about this possibility and the possible ripple effects across the chip industry. Maybe ASML's decision makers have already predicted this and have some alternatives for SIEMENS? maybe they have secretly acquired the majority of the shares already?

However, one must be cautious because a $150mm mkt cap biotech with $200mm cash can still fail since many of them are burning $50-70mm dollars a year on R&amp;D and overhead costs. If the products are still in Phase 1 or early Phase 2, the company could run out of cash or be forced to sell stock at highly dilutive terms. A perfect example of this is $ALNA. However, you can find some like $PASG where commercialization is closer and the cash pile is large.

2) Beaten up and forgotten: These tend to be companies that might have gone public in the last few years and rapidly fell out of favor or were forgotten. This is the most promising type to look for as they usually have revenues, if not profits, which dramatically increases survival risk. $XL is a great example of this type. The company retrofits commercial fleets for EV/hybrid conversions. The company raised a pile of cash at the IPO in 2019 which should last for at least 3 years. There were many of these types after the 2000 tech bubble and many of them ended up being acquired for nice premiums eventually, but you had to be patient. 

I invite you to share any Net-Nets you find and I will take a look and give my quick take on them. 

Happy hunting!

&gt; Rates have fallen swiftly from their 13-year high of 5.81% in June

&gt; Mortgage rates dropped to their lowest level since April, offering a reprieve to prospective home buyers who have been hit this year with higher rates and surging prices.

&gt; The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 4.99% this week, down from 5.30% a week earlier, according to a survey by mortgage giant Freddie Mac published Thursday. Though rates remain well above their levels from a year ago, they have fallen swiftly in recent weeks from their 13-year high of 5.81% in June.
&gt; 
&gt; Sales of previously owned homes fell for a fifth straight month in June, according to the most recent data from the National Association of Realtors.
&gt; 
&gt; Mortgage rates are tied closely to the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which tends to move in tandem with expectations for the Fed‚Äôs benchmark rate. On Monday, the 10-year yield slipped to its lowest level since April.

Investors should continue to be cautious with the bear market set to drag on, according to Evercore ISI managing director Julian Emanuel.

Emanuel warned that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue to be hawkish into 2023, with rising interest rates likely suppressing stocks' growth.

""There is more work to be done in terms of hiking before we sound more of an all-clear, particularly for the equity markets,"" he told CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' Wednesday. ""The Fed has really made it clear that the last thing that they want to do is get into a position where for some reason, they have to cut rates subsequently in 2023, simply because the inflation problem may not have been cured.""

Stocks rallied in July despite the Fed hiking interest rates 75 basis points for the second consecutive month. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 8.6% to climb back above 4,000 points, while the Nasdaq jumped 14.9%.

But Emanuel advised investors to brace for a fresh bout of volatility in September.

""To us \[this\] is much more typical of sort of late-cycle August coming into September, which tends to be a dangerous month, type of behavior,"" he said.

Emanuel advised investors to continue to act cautiously when buying and selling stocks and said it could be a good strategy to hold cash if necessary.

""As the market runs higher, you want to trim some of your position,"" he said. ""So again, you can be in a better position to buy weakness when it materializes.""",Evercore says to brace for more volatility ahead of a 'dangerous month' as the bear market drags on,2022-08-04
stocks,"The Bank of England raised interest rates by the most in 27 years on Thursday, despite warning that a long recession is on its way, as it rushed to smother a rise in inflation which is now set to top 13%.

Reeling from a surge in energy prices caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 for a half percentage point rise in Bank Rate to 1.75% - its highest level since late 2008 - from 1.25%.


The 50-basis-point increase had been expected by most economists in a Reuters poll as central banks around the world scramble to contain the surge in prices.

MPC member Silvana Tenreyro cast a lone vote for a smaller 25-basis-point increase.

The BoE warned that Britain was facing a recession with a peak-to-trough fall in output of 2.1%, similar to a slump in the 1990s but far less than the hit from COVID-19 and the downturn caused by the 2008-09 global financial crisis.


British consumer price inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.4% in June, already more than four times the BoE's 2% target, triggering industrial action and putting pressure on whoever succeeds Boris Johnson as Britain's next prime minister to come up with further support.


The BoE had previously expected inflation to peak at above 11% and almost no growth in Britain's economy before 2025 at the earliest.

In its new forecasts, the BoE saw inflation falling back to 2% in two years' time as the hit to the economy took its toll on demand.

The British central bank has now raised rates six times since December but Thursday's move was the biggest since 1995.

The pressure on Governor Andrew Bailey and colleagues to move in larger steps intensified after recent big rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other central banks.

Those moves weakened the value of the pound, which can add to inflation.

The BoE repeated that it was ready to move forcefully if needed to stem more persistent inflationary pressures.

But it stressed that there were ""extremely large"" uncertainties about the economy - which could make the slowdown more or less severe than its core forecasts - and it would judge what its next moves should be as events unfold.","Bank of England hikes interest rates by 50 basis points to 1.75%,warning the UK economy faces a long recession",2022-08-04

Given how hot inflation is today I'm not sure what to make of the fact that 10 year seems to be pricing a return to the post-GFC status quo (today it's at 2.7%). I understand that the market is worrying about growth and a potential recession, but is it reasonable that the 10 year is trading around the same levels it has for the last decade, a decade where inflationary pressures have been historically low?

While I don't believe that we're about to enter a secular high inflationary environment, it seems quite likely to me that inflation pressures this decade will at least be slightly higher than they were in the last decade, and therefore perhaps a more reasonable yield for the 10 year would be 3% - 4%.

I've not seen much discussion here around the recent moves in the bond market, but clearly the bond market has been the primary driver of tech stock gains over the last few weeks.

* More FUD is to come with delisting threats, and a primary listing in Hong Kong won't come until the end of the year. Without solid fundamentals, price might suffer.
* International expansion is slow (2% growth YoY) and is finding it difficult to find the correct route.

**Bullish things:**

* It is a solid business. It is a cash printing machine and it has a privileged position in the Asian market.
* Big investors like Charlie Munger back the stock and act as a hedge against delisting FUD.
* It is objectively undervalued due to the uncertainty and risks involved with the chinese government. High risk high reward opportunity.

stocks,"Hi. 

I've come across this company and would like your opinions on it as a long term investment. Please feel free to rip apart my thesis.

Overview: OraSure Technologies, Inc., is a BioTech company together with its subsidiaries, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells oral fluid diagnostic products and specimen collection devices in the United States, Europe, and internationally. These products covers a huge range including the bacterial microbiome which is an emerging topic being widely adopted, investigated and is rapidly accelerating in research efforts in the life sciences. They are also big on rapid COVID-19 testing kits, Rapid HIV testing kits, rapid EBOLA testing kits and recently a new HCV testing KIT.  

Insider trading shows lots of shares being brought by members of the team over the last 3 month. Share ownership (individual 4%, hedge funds 6%, institutions 90% - Blackrock 19%, vanguard 7%, capital management 6% etc). Most recent filings show every major shareholder is buying more of the stock at these prices (managed account +29%, vanguard +2.2%). No meaningful share dilution over the last few years. 

No major results on DATAROMA (hedge funds, high net worth individuals buying/selling shares). 

No major results on OpenInsider (SEC form 4 - Internal trading).

Financials:

Reporting earning on the 8th august. YDT (-73%), MarketCap: $351m. Shareprice $3.23. Underperformed the US medical equipment industry by -23%.  P/E -5. EPS -0.65. Net profit -19.3% YTD. Forecast annual sales growth -12.5%. DCF 1 years $7 (+61%). Balance sheet: $112m cash, $112 physical assets, liabilities $43m, receivables $76m.

History: Founded in 1986, employees: 785 (and increasing). New management team of 1.3 years. new CEO Carrie Manner, very experiences in the life sciences and good track history. 

tltr: My overall thesis is that BioTech is going to do well over the next 5 years. OSUR has a very cyclical price action. A lot of the subsidiary company (Diversigen for example), are expanding and becoming more adopted in the life sciences due to being very cost competitive. The company is at a very attractive valuation.",Thoughts on OraSure Technologies (OSUR),2022-08-04

stocks,"The bullish interpretation of second quarter earnings appears to be that, overall, results were ‚Äúbetter than feared.‚Äù And it seems that interpretation is the one favored by the market at the moment.

The S&amp;P 500 has gained 13% from an 18-month low reached in June. Earnings reports have clearly been a factor, both in terms of broader sentiment and in driving gains in some of the index‚Äôs leaders.

There are reasons for optimism, admittedly. Year-prior comparisons should get a bit easier in Q3 and beyond. On the whole, results don‚Äôt look terrible. With equities still down sharply from the highs ‚Äî the S&amp;P is off 14.5%, and the Russell 2000 23% ‚Äî perhaps there really is a buying opportunity here.

## Roku (ROKU)

In this space, we‚Äôve been consistent in arguing otherwise. ROKU looks like a bear market rally ‚Äî because it still looks like equity investors aren‚Äôt quite grasping the entire plot.

On Wednesday, I argued that Roku was [a perfect example](https://www.investing.com/analysis/roku-stock-is-the-epitome-of-this-market-200628018) of this outlook. Investors still have not grasped the fact that equities in 2021 not only featured ridiculous valuations ‚Äî at its peak, Roku traded at 27x eventual 2021 platform revenue, and had a market cap over $60 billion ‚Äî but that those valuations sat atop unsustainable financial performance.

Meanwhile, Roku is now pointing to macro pressures in advertising demand driving year-over-year declines. But in Q2 2021, the company certainly wasn‚Äôt out there telling investors ‚Äúwe‚Äôre growing gangbusters because this is essentially the absolutely perfect environment for a streaming platform.‚Äù Just because 2022 is *worse* than 2021 on a relative basis doesn‚Äôt mean the current environment is *bad* on a relative basis.

It‚Äôs not just a revenue issue, but a margin one. Companies were able to take so much pricing, either directly or in Roku‚Äôs case somewhat indirectly (via strength in the ad scatter market). Put simply, investors looking for some kind of macro bottom need to first understand what an incredible macro top we just saw. From here, Roku‚Äôs results look far less like the result of a recession, and far more like the result of normalization.

## Tesla (TSLA)

Personally and professionally, we‚Äôve been added to the long list of those burned by the ‚Äúshort TSLA‚Äù trade. Tesla stock has rallied (ugh) 32% since [we recommended a short](https://www.overlookedalpha.com/p/new-case-short-tesla-stock?s=w) less than two months ago.

In that piece, we argued for a short thesis based not on some of the conspiracy theories (or, at least, conspiracy-adjacent theories) that bears have promulgated about the company and the stock. We don‚Äôt believe Tesla‚Äôs reported results are fraudulent. We don‚Äôt believe that Elon Musk is playing games with the stock[1](https://www.overlookedalpha.com/p/research-notes-earnings-season-so#footnote-1).

But the last two months show why those theories can gain traction. Tesla‚Äôs Q2 results were‚Ä¶fine? There certainly appears little to assuage concerns about competition in China and elsewhere. There appears to be nothing that materially adds to the long-term uber-bull thesis that Tesla is ‚Äúmore than a car manufacturer‚Äù. Yet here we are, with a company that *is* just a car manufacturer[2](https://www.overlookedalpha.com/p/research-notes-earnings-season-so#footnote-2) seeing its valuation rise by nearly one-third in eight weeks. Here we are, with Tesla heading back toward a trillion-dollar market cap while economic and political uncertainty roils key growth markets.

It‚Äôs hard to blame [a Musk-driven gamma squeeze](https://twitter.com/InvResDynamics/status/1550326604253040641) for the gains, but given the list of choices we can understand why some investors reach for that type of explanation. Simply put, we don‚Äôt get it.

## Amazon (AMZN)

To be fair, some investors might well say the same thing about Amazon. A \~$1.4 trillion market cap is supported by first-half revenue growth of 7% and negative trailing twelve-month free cash flow. Q2 earnings didn‚Äôt look much better than those of Tesla, yet AMZN soared 10% after the report, adding a cool \~$120 billion in market cap in the process. (That‚Äôs an IBM (IBM) or an American Express (AXP) worth of value.)

But I argued this week that the [stock still looks intriguing](https://www.investing.com/analysis/amazons-q3-earnings-show-why-stock-remains-a-longterm-buy-200627959) (though I personally have no position). The sum-of-the-parts case driven by Amazon Web Services, Prime subscription revenue, and advertising maybe doesn‚Äôt quite get to the ‚Äúretail business for free!‚Äù case, but all three businesses are spectacular.

Largely unmentioned is a key question that I‚Äôm almost excited to see answered: how much money are these Big Tech companies ~~wasting~~ ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù? With [layoffs across all of tech](https://news.yahoo.com/tesla-apple-microsoft-peloton-all-of-tech-companies-hitting-the-brakes-on-hiring-202428628.html), we‚Äôll get a bit of an answer going forward.

From here, it seems likely that Amazon is spending enough money on future-focused initiatives that it‚Äôs badly underearning here in the present. But, at least for now, it‚Äôs impossible to have a ton of certainty in that belief, or to assign a value near or above $2 trillion to Amazon stock based on educated (at best) guesses.

## Microsoft (MSFT)

It really wasn‚Äôt that long ago that Microsoft was a dog. Here‚Äôs Microsoft‚Äôs adjusted earnings per share over a five-year period (fiscal years end June):

* Fiscal 2012: $2.73
* FY13: $2.65
* FY14: $2.63
* FY15: $2.46
* FY16: $2.79

From the beginning of 2010 to the beginning of 2013, MSFT stock *declined* 12%. The NASDAQ 100 rallied 42%. Fundamentally and qualitatively, what IBM was in last few years of the 2010s Microsoft was in the first few years: a mature company being lapped by smaller, nimbler rivals and failing to drive any real growth at all.

Since the beginning of 2013 (the market began to position for the turnaround well ahead of time, interestingly enough), MSFT has gained 957%; including dividends, total return now clears 1,100%. Earnings have increased 230% over the past six years.

And yet, there‚Äôs an intriguing question: what did Microsoft really do differently? Obviously, the Azure cloud platform has been a big factor, but that wasn‚Äôt Microsoft‚Äôs idea: Amazon beat the company to the punch, and still maintains a healthy market share lead. More generally, the shift from on-premise to cloud has been a boon, particularly for Office 365, but that too wasn‚Äôt *really* Microsoft‚Äôs idea, but rather a broad trend across the software industry.

Microsoft hasn‚Äôt shot itself in the foot, certainly. There‚Äôs no deal as bad as the Nokia (NOK) smartphone acquisition (Microsoft paid $5.4 billion under former chief executive officer Steve Ballmer and sold the business [for $350 million](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-selling-its-feature-phone-business-for-350m/) under current CEO Satya Nadella). But LinkedIn probably rates a ‚Äòneutral‚Äô (Microsoft paid just under 2x FY22 revenue, so it probably did OK ignoring the fact that it could have repurchased shares with that cash), and Microsoft likely missed out on potential deals (assuming it paid in cash, not in stock).

At the least, there isn‚Äôt some grand turnaround story to tell here. Nadella deserves some credit, and Microsoft clearly executes exceptionally well. But it is interesting how *normal* Microsoft‚Äôs growth appears, even in retrospect.

It‚Äôs difficult to take much of a lesson from that observation, whether in regards to Microsoft stock or investing more broadly. One lesson *not* to take is the ‚Äúthis turnaround could work ‚Äî look at Microsoft!‚Äù card, a la ‚Äúyou have to buy the dip ‚Äî AMZN went to $6 in 2001!‚Äù

Because what happened here to a large degree happened purely because Microsoft had such reach. Customers of dominant old-line manufacturers ‚Äî Ford (F), General Electric (GE), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) ‚Äî had customers use their products at least once almost every day. Microsoft customers use its products dozens of times almost every day. And so when the world changed in Microsoft‚Äôs favor, its earnings skyrocketed. Not many companies have that kind of reach.

## Apple (AAPL)

It doesn‚Äôt seem like a coincidence that three of the companies that do have reach ‚Äî Amazon, Microsoft and Apple ‚Äî bucked the trend of cautious outlooks.

In essence, it‚Äôs starting to look like these names ‚Äî yes, even Amazon ‚Äî might be much more defensive than investors realized. The question is whether that‚Äôs necessarily a good thing at the moment.

After all, investors certainly seem to be pricing all three stocks as such. AAPL is now down just 9% from its highs, and using very basic technical analysis the stock seems headed to once again test resistance.

MSFT seems to have more room to run to the upside, but at 24x forward earnings (that‚Äôs FY24, by the way) is hardly inexpensive. As noted, AMZN is intriguing but it‚Äôs hardly a value play.

These are the leaders of this market ‚Äî the stocks that investors appear to want to own. The problem is that in a bull market, these defensive names are usually the last ones to fall. See, for instance, Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) in 2008-09.

I get the argument for owning these businesses long-term. History suggests, however, that a ‚Äúflight to quality‚Äù despite valuation and macro concerns is usually the signal of a bear market rally rather than a bottom.

## Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)

One of these companies is not like the others, admittedly. But I‚Äôm truly a bit stunned at how little attention has been paid to Q2 earnings from Stanley Black &amp; Decker.

Revenue did increase 16% year-over-year. But per the 10-Q (p.44), organic growth was [negative 8%](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/93556/000009355622000036/swk-20220702.htm). Volume fell 13%.

Adjusted EPS was $1.77 vs $2.81 the year before. Stanley Black &amp; Decker slashed full-year guidance to $5.00-$6.00 from $9.50 to $10.50.

There are leverage and cost inflation factors at play, certainly. But this is one of the worst quarters you‚Äôll ever see. And it seems like a screaming alarm for the home improvement industry. Each of Lowe‚Äôs (LOW) and Home Depot (HD) accounted for 15% of SBD revenue in 2021.

Both home improvement giants have been sold off this year, admittedly, with HD down 26% year-to-date and LOW 24%. But both came into the year with almost absurd valuations: as we‚Äôve noted before, HD traded at 26x 2021 EPS. Again, we see historically high multiples being applied to historically strong results ‚Äî a hugely dangerous combination.

HD still trades at 18.6x this year‚Äôs consensus. It‚Äôs fair to ask why, exactly, investors are modeling in long-term growth from the current base, and why, exactly, those investors are treating HD as if it‚Äôs not a) cyclical and b) a retailer of goods.

From here, Stanley Black &amp; Decker results seem like a canary in the coal mine. And no one is listening.

I‚Äôd be very cautious about owning either stock into Q2 earnings later this month. And I‚Äôd take a look at the options market. Straddle pricing for HD suggests a move from here through Aug. 19 (the Friday after earnings) of barely 5%. Modestly out-of-the-money puts look intriguing.

There‚Äôs absolutely a scenario where the story surrounding home improvement stocks changes dramatically two weeks from now. If that scenario plays out, the Stanley Black &amp; Decker report won‚Äôt look like an outlier, but a harbinger.

stocks,"Lithium miner Albemarle crushed second-quarter earnings expectations. It also crushed its own guidance. It was quite a beat-and-raise quarter for the company. Albemarle (ticker: ALB) announced adjusted per-share earnings of $3.45 from $1.48 billion in sales. Wall Street was looking for $3.04 from $1.43 billion in sales. It‚Äôs another earnings beat, the company‚Äôs 13th consecutive, according to Bloomberg. What‚Äôs more, the company raised guidance for the third time in 2022.

Management now expects to generate earnings of about $20.75 a share from $7.3 billion in sales in 2022. Prior guidance, given in late May, projected earnings of about $14.65 a share from $6 billion in sales. It‚Äôs a huge increase. The company has managed to capture more of lithium‚Äôs price rise in its current business. Benchmark lithium prices have risen more than 400% over the past year.

Investors certainly were impressed. Shares rose 4.8% in after-hours trading Wednesday to about $251. Wall Street was impressed too. ‚ÄúAnother huge beat and raise,‚Äù wrote Citigroup analyst P.J. Juvekar. ‚ÄúPrice leverage surprises ‚Äî really surprises ‚Äî to the upside,‚Äù wrote Evercore ISI analyst Stephen Richardson. Neither had much negative to point out. Richardson noted that a tight lithium market is providing Albemarle with ‚Äúunprecedented pricing power.‚Äù Both analysts rate Albemarle stock a Buy. Juvekar‚Äôs price target is $289 a share. Richardson‚Äôs price target is $280.

Lithium prices have been moving up as demand for lithium-ion batteries used to power electric vehicles grows. Management will host an earnings conference call on Thursday at 9 a.m. Eastern time to discuss results. Analysts and investors will want to hear about the direction of lithium pricing in 2023 as well as where lithium prices might level out in the long run.

The hive mind is HORRRIBLE for good decision making, especially in a sub like this where people's money/emotion is on the line.  Good content gets censored by downvotes if it doesnt follow the status quo. 

Most redditors have no idea how to consider evaluative metrics... ie people on here use a high PE ratio to justify not investing in a high growth stock.. rather they just regurgitate info they have heard.

Reddit focuses on a handful of retail stocks that historically underperform the market.  For example, there are ZERO reddit posts about companies like SPGI (S&amp;P Global Inc.), a relatively safe choice with an average 25% return.. and rather reddit focuses on shit.

I checked on it today, and it looks like back in January they issued a 1:150 reverse split on the stock that I'm holding.

To my understanding, I should have been cashed out since I had less shares than the reverse split was issued for, but instead I've still got 1 stock, valued at $25.

It signed a $1.74 billion deal with the U.S. government last week for 66 million doses to be available this fall and winter, if cleared by health regulators. Despite the contract, Moderna kept its sales forecast unchanged as doses earmarked for the COVAX vaccine sharing program remain unallocated due to low demand.

If these people are so good and expert at stocks (fundamental / technical analysis etc) that they can trade and invest for others, why do they still work at offices like everyone else? Couldn't they just do it themselves and get rich?

Easy answer might be that the fundamental and technical analysis theory are not what it's cracked up to be, but in that case, what gives them the right to do invest and trade for others? Especially if they can't beat the return of a total market fund or something in the long run.

Around a week ago the market seemed to not care about the Core PCE data that surged higher to 4.8% in June which broke a 3 month downtrend. Jerome Powell explicitly stated that if Core inflation was to remain elevated or turn higher, the FOMC will continue hiking rates. Although there are signs of falling inflation such as the commodity price downtrend and slight evidence of supply chains easing, this discounts the fact that demand remains strong for most consumer goods albeit a little signs of slowing. Furthermore, there are still supply shortages for oil and service inflation is becoming increasingly out of control. Finally it's extremely difficult to understand why markets will rally when QE is slowly being taken away, rates are still rising, and stimulus from congress no longer exists. All of those circumstances I mentioned were used in 2020 which caused a market rally and higher revenue and profit growth for most companies.

&gt; At least **$21 billion** in fresh **share repurchase programs** have been unveiled **this week** alone, with PayPal Inc. leading the charge and authorizing a new $15 billion buyback plan as it works with Elliott Investment Management to turn around its struggling shares. Moderna Inc., Airbnb Inc. and Marriott International Inc. have also added to or unveiled new programs in the last three days, following a slew of others, including Chevron Corp., Charles Schwab Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp. that did it last week. 
&gt; 
&gt; Altogether **buyback announcements for the second quarter earnings season have already surpassed 2018 highs**, when companies said they planned to repurchase almost $400 billion of their own shares, according to data compiled by BNP Paribas. And the announcements may not be over yet, with more than 50 S&amp;P 500 members still set to report earnings still this week. 
&gt; 
&gt; PayPal and Moderna saw outsize share price jumps following their buyback announcements, adding 8.8% and 16% respectively on Wednesday. Shares in The Charles Schwab Corp., which announced a $15 billion buyback plan last week, are up 11%.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúBuybacks should provide another flow tailwind,‚Äù BNP Paribas Equity Derivatives Strategist Maxwell Grinacoff wrote in a note on Monday. Announced **buybacks have hit the highest in more than a decade**, Maxwell added.
&gt; 
&gt; For Wall Street strategists schooled in the logic of ‚Äúbuy low, sell high‚Äù, buybacks this year likely make complete sense. Companies like PayPal and Moderna have slumped more than 25% amid a boom-to-bust cycle for pandemic winners turned losers. By scooping up shares at a lower value, the company can theoretically resell them later on in a secondary offering, ideally at a higher price, to help raise additional capital.
&gt; 
&gt; Smaller companies or less hefty programs don‚Äôt always give a meaningful boost to shares. The S&amp;P 500 Buyback Index, which tracks 100 stocks with the highest buyback ratio, has underperformed the broader market since the start of May, falling about 3% compared to a nearly unchanged S&amp;P 500.
&gt; 
&gt; One notable exception this season among companies known for supporting robust buybacks are banks. **JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc. announced they would be pausing current share repurchase programs in order to help meet higher capital requirements** following the Federal Reserve stress test. JP Morgan and Citigroup shares, up 4.9% and 2.8% respectively, are trailing the broad S&amp;P 500 9.6% advance since July 14.

The long term consequences seems more dire. Taiwan supplies 90 % of the worlds advanced electronic chips. To produce these they need to import sand, which just was banned by China to sell to the Island state.

Further on, Chinese naval assets are suroundering Taiwan, and will comit live fire exercises above the Island. For the first time in history. The risk of a stray rocket is high, but what is more understated is that this litteraly would be a blockade of Taiwan both at sea and air. The question is just how long will it last.

stocks,"Remember, your dollars are worth less now.  

Depending on why you are investing, what you are saving for, they may be worth a LOT less.  You wanted a car?  You need a full recovery back to the beginning of the year's valuations, but also another 25 to 30% on top of that to be break even.  Maybe you were investing for longer term, to build up savings for a house?  Again, you need a full recovery back to where things were, but you can't even sell then.  House valuations went up.  Rich people insulated themselves from inflation by buying lots of rent-seeking properties.  So much people are saying there isn't enough on the market.  And, people that buy up properties for investment reasons as we saw, they do not need to desparately sell during high inflation, during high rate hikes, or even during a recession.  They can ride this out to insure they have great gains.  And all that means is you need your savings and investments to fully recover, BUT also gain 20 to 40%, maybe even more depending on your market/area.

Bottom line is, even if this rally restores our balances, it's not enough to coerce anyone to exchange for now worth less dollars.

&gt;AAPL investors need to see inside the company‚Äôs ‚Äú$70 billion black box,‚Äù say analysts ‚Äì a reference to Apple lumping together all its Services revenue into one figure, despite the fact that it effectively covers ten different businesses with the company.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Apple used to be relatively open about its sources of income, including reporting individual sales figures for iPhone, iPad, and Mac.  
&gt;  
&gt;That changed in 2018, when the company announced that it would cease to report sales numbers, and would instead reveal only the revenue stream for each product line. Given the range of retail prices for different models, that made it much harder to get a sense of how well particular product lines were selling.  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple reporting Services income as a single figure didn‚Äôt used to be much of an issue back in the days when we knew it was the App Store plus much smaller miscellaneous income for other things.  
&gt;  
&gt;But things are very different today. Services is a huge element of the company‚Äôs earnings. The business is worth way more than Mac and iPad put together, and it‚Äôs getting close to the combined totals of Mac + iPad + AirPods + Apple Watch. Heck, as of the most recent numbers it‚Äôs almost half as big as iPhone revenue!  
  
&gt;  
&gt;iPhone: $40.67 billion  
&gt;  
&gt;Mac: $7.38 billion

I have seen the evidence of the profit he makes for each transaction, but advises me that if I had invested more, I would be eligible for a larger quantity of different markets and transactions and therefore significantly more profit.

I can take a loan out from my current bank, to get to the next bracket for markets and transactions, and I can afford to pay the monthly instalments at present, even if I make no extra income.

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures traded higher Wednesday, as traders tried to regain their footing following back-to-back losing sessions.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 143 points, or 0.44%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each gained 0.48%.
*****
&gt; Those moves came as Wall Street worried that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs visit to Taiwan could further strain already tense U.S.-China relations. China had spent weeks warning her not to make the trip. Markets fell further after three Federal Reserve presidents hinted that further rate hikes would be necessary to combat high inflation.
*****
&gt; Traders also digested mixed remarks from Federal Reserve officials. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Tuesday he was confident that the U.S. economy could achieve a ‚Äúsoft landing.‚Äù Meanwhile, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said the central bank‚Äôs work to tame inflation is ‚Äúfar from done,‚Äù while Chicago Fed‚Äôs Charles Evans said there‚Äôs a chance for a smaller rate hike at the next monetary policy meeting.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúDespite the fact most of today‚Äôs attention is still riveted on the Federal Reserve and its ongoing fight to bring inflation under control, many economic policies have already embarked on a new easing cycle,‚Äù said The Leuthold Group‚Äôs Jim Paulsen. ‚ÄúThe prospect of lower inflation is not only helping to usher in a new easing cycle but is apt to stoke a private-sector confidence revival that has untapped potential.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating another batch of second-quarter earnings. CVS, Regeneron, Under Armour and Moderna will report before the bell Wednesday.
*****
&gt; In economic data, investors this week are awaiting mortgage demand numbers and PMI data out Wednesday.

stocks,"I‚Äôm a non US citizen. Through an investment company I bought shares in a US company. The company is in the process of being bought out by a larger company, so my shares have been cashed out for a decent profit. My fund manager had me apply for an ITIN as the payout would mean paying tax to the IRS on my profits. I‚Äôve now been given a notice from the IRS, through my fund manager, invoicing me for the tax on the income, which my fund manager says I have to pay up front before the funds can be released to me. This seems strange to me. I‚Äôve never heard of tax being paid before income is received. My fund manager says it‚Äôs something to do with the fact that I don‚Äôt have a US bank account and the funds will be immediately transferred overseas to me, beyond the reach of the IRS, which is why they want the tax paid in advance.

I‚Äôve tried to contact the IRS but the notice I have been sent has the last 4 digits of the ITIN missing, appearing as XXXX on the invoice. My fund manager doesn‚Äôt have access to the full number either. When I call the IRS I can‚Äôt get any answers without the full 9 digit ITIN.

Can anyone tell me if this is a legitimate request by the IRS, or is this some sort of scam? The tax bill is quite substantial and I‚Äôm not prepared to pay it until I have proof that everything is legitimate.

stocks,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs visit to Taiwan could threaten the buildup of the electric-vehicle supply chain in North America. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that a decision about the location of a new battery plant in Nort America from Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (ticker: 300750.China), which is better known as CATL, would be delayed because of the trip. CATL didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.

The company is the world‚Äôs largest maker of EV batteries and the plant in North America would have been its first. Output for the plant has been tied to Ford Motor (F) and Tesla (TSLA). Ford, for instance, disclosed in late July that CATL would supply the auto maker with lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries. LFP batteries are cheaper than batteries with more expensive metals such as cobalt. LFP batteries don‚Äôt pack as much energy, but still are a good option for auto makers looking to manage costs on EVs with lower per charge range. Ford Motor and Tesla didn‚Äôt respond request for comment from Barron‚Äôs.

Most batteries for EVs today are made in Asia, and most EV battery materials are processed in China. That makes some sense since China sells the most EVs. China has also made it easy to build manufacturing capacity in the country. (China accounted for roughly 30% of the world‚Äôs manufacturing output in 2021, according to the World Bank, up from about 20% in 2011 and about 10% in 2006.)

U.S. auto makers are trying to shift battery market share to the West. Ford and Tesla along, with other global auto makers including General Motors (GM), have announced billions in battery capacity and deals that help localize the supply chain. Most of the capacity is being built in partnership with existing battery makers including LG Chem (051910.Korea) and SK Innovation (096770.Korea). Existing battery makers including Panasonic (6752.Japan) are also building North American-based capacity on their own.

A lot of spending is scheduled from many parties besides CATL. And the reported delay in site selection could be just that ‚Äî a delay. Still, a potential delay is a reminder that geopolitics are complicated.

CATL fell 3.8% on Wednesday in Shanghai. Ford shares dropped 1.2% on Tuesday, while Tesla gained 1.1%. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively, on Tuesday.

stocks,"Lately the idea has stuck with me that you should think of stocks as the means to becoming a part owner of a company in order to support them. As Warren Buffet has said, you should try to find great companies with stocks at great prices.

So the IDEA is now in my head that I can start researching and hunting for companies that match my interests and entice me to give them some of my money for support. 

But this gets a little difficult because it becomes a matter of searching for information that might not be easily accessible, and leaves me with many questions. 

For example, should 90% of my research consist of sifting through their spendings/annual report to work out if they're making decent profit, giving back to the shareholders, and spending their money wisely? Is there really any way to work out if the CEO or another high-up is corrupt and will fuck over the company in the long-run? Can you learn about how a company functions other than what THEY provide on their website (which will obviously always be postively-biased) or new articles?

For companies like Amazon and Apple there would be an abundance of information available. They're billion dollar companies and they must be mostly transparent. But for smaller startup companies I feel as though information can be very sparse. 

Is this where I must enter super-businessman mode and rock up in person to get a feel for how the company operates, and whether the staff are motivated to work, or if it's actually a shit company that no one wants to work at?

Don't get me wrong I'm super excited to start researching and support companies doing great things, I'm just very overwhelmed with where to start!",What's your favourite method for finding great stocks to invest in?,2022-08-03

stocks,"So the title says it all. With the recent HKD situation, I feel like there is still a possibility of making a stock that lets you day trade. It could be called the stock fund or something like that. So how it would work is you would gather 100,000 shares and IPO at $1 each. You can then forcefully increase the display price but it wouldn't be worth that much, maybe possibly at around $250 at 3:50pm EST, since some brokers require you to have a 25k portfolio before close to day trade. The price could also be changed based on how many people want to day trade, or even do stock splits on it. The reason why it wouldn't be 25k is because exchanges can completely delist the stock, and I don't think FINRA likes it. But yeah, why hasn't anyone made this?

stocks,"I'm a bit of a newbie with stocks and have only really been trading since the beginning of the year. What I've noticed when reviewing stock prices over time for the many stocks I now have is that everything was so much higher last fall and summer. I realize that the market was seriously over-inflated because of Covid and all that fun, but I'm just curious how far people think it can reasonably recover. Can I look to earlier this year or spring prices for a better idea on where most stock prices should eventually return to, or are we now just in a much much lower market? 

My main reason for asking is to try to figure out which stocks to hold long term and which to take short-term gains on. For example, I bought Carvana at $21 a share and it's now over $30, which is a good profit. But when I see it was trading for over $100 a share in April, I think that maybe I should keep it in my long-term pile to hold on to. I know it won't get back to the $300+ it was trading for in the fall anytime soon (if ever), but it's just insane to me how much all the prices have fallen in just a year. And when I see a similar pattern of dropping prices in a majority of my stocks, I'm thinking that they will eventually regain some value -- but how much? If they have all fallen by 60-70%, I can see that most of it is because the entire market has dropped and not just that one stock.

I came across these two services (both have a free trial accounts and I tried both but lack the experience to decide which is best)

In short:

Outprfrmr looks at what a bunch of financial analysts have predicted for a stock, rates them by age of report, and accuracy of analyst for the last year for that stock. And gives that stock a score of confidence and the predicted upturn.

Tykr doesn't rely on human analysts, instead it looks at 5 years of data such as net income, revenue, EPS, ASSETS, Free cash, debt, liabilities and equity and based on that their AI calculates a final score of confidence and the MOS.

Both services seem really good for a newbie like me (and to be honest with my ""getting my feet wet"" budget I probably would first be sticking to a few penny stocks and a few stocks in the big ones )

Hey Guys,

This morning I made a post about the NYSE ticker: HKD. I was confused how a ‚Äûpump and dumb‚Äú realizes a market cap of 150 billion. 

Guess what happened the post got viral but unfortunately the mods removed the post.

So the definition of a pump and dumb:

‚ÄûPump-and-dump is a manipulative scheme that attempts to boost the price of a stock or security through fake recommendations. These recommendations are based on false, misleading, or greatly exaggerated statements. The perpetrators of a pump-and-dump scheme already have an established position in the company's stock and will sell their positions after the hype has led to a higher share price.‚Äú

Typical characteristics of a P&amp;D:

- Pump-and-dump is an illegal scheme to boost a stock's or security's price based on false, misleading, or greatly exaggerated statements.

- Pump-and-dump schemes usually target micro- and small-cap stocks.

stocks,"Per the title. I'm curious about how you originally decided to invest in what are now your longest/best holdings. What made you take notice of those companies in the first place? What have you learned from whatever methodology you used to make those top picks? 

I think it's useful to honestly look back at the original thesis/logic if we want to replicate success. It's easy to get sidetracked with strategy, but in the end, the proof is in the pudding, so to speak...so what went into your pudding?

&amp;#x200B;

**For me:** 

The longer I continue my journey with stocks (\~15 years now), the more I favor getting back to the basic axiom of investing in what you know. Of course this is a well known strategy (Peter Lynch, etc.), but I've been thinking more about it lately in the context of my own portfolio and how it has evolved over time. Most of the stocks that turned out best for me follow this rule, though I wasn't explicitly following the Lynch playbook at the time (because I didn't know who he was at the time). 

My top 5 most successful (and also longest...not a coincidence) holdings are:

* AAPL - 10 years - bought after buying my first iPhone and being absolutely blown away by it, coming from an Android device. iPhone seemed almost absurdly better than its nearest competition at that time, which seemed like a pretty good investment thesis. Bought the stock. 
* COST - 8 years - bought after visiting a Costco with my parents in law and then immediately joining myself.  Bought the stock as soon as I experienced it. I still love Costco, the company and the stock. 
* CRM - 5 years - bought after selecting Salesforce as our main operations hub at my former employer. Become familiar with Salesforce admin, saw its power and flexibility, saw it in action, saw how it moved the dial. Bought the stock. 
* UPS - 5 years - Was working a lot with FedEx. Their service was slipping and prices were going up. Missed deliveries. Not easy to deal with. Started using UPS...better service, better store experience, better prices, more reliable deliveries. Bought the stock. And of course they started eating FedEx's lunch.
* AVGO - 4 years - This is the outlier. I bought based on a generally favorable outlook for semis, and they seemed highly financially secure, are broadly exposed to the semiconductor industry (sort of a picks and shovels play; AMAT is my other), and pays a large and growing dividend. Worked out well despite my lack of directly personal knowledge. 

Conclusion: I didn't read Lynch until relatively recently, and I wish I'd discovered him earlier, because the foundation of my portfolio is composed of my ""Lynch stocks"", and in hindsight, I could have avoided a lot of painful lessons if I'd just started out picking from a basket of companies I know, like, admire and trust. 

I'm increasingly thinking that ""invest in what you know"" is less about finding the best companies - though that's part of it - and more about finding the deep conviction to hang tight over many years, which is where a lot of the outperformance is generated. 

I also note that none of these picks were particularly cheap when I bought them. The best companies are rarely cheap.

The last time job openings dipped below 11 million was in November last year.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

stocks,"Investors worried about the next pullback for stocks might want to pause and consider this: the decline in equity valuations since the start of the year already has exceeded the average pullback of other recessionary periods since the early 1990s, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.‚Äôs equity quant Marko Kolanovic. While more Wall Street analysts have been painting a grim picture of the trajectory of corporate profits this year, Kolanovic, who successfully called the summer stock-market rebound, said investors might be pricing in too dire of an outcome for stocks, even if the American economy falters.

Instead, U.S. equity valuations already were seeing a dramatic re-rating lower, even by the standard of a typical recession, he argued, in a Monday research note. As part of his bullish argument, Kolanovic looked at the next-twelve months (NTM) price-to-earnings ratio ‚Äî perhaps the most popular ratio used to express equity valuations ‚Äî and found that it exceeded the average pullback in recessionary periods over the past 30 years.

Kolanovic also found that this year‚Äôs pullback would be the second-biggest to follow a recession, should one be declared. To be sure, valuations (using NTM earnings expectations as the denominator) occasionally have been lower, like when stocks bottomed in March 2020 in response to the COVID pandemic. During said pullback, the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs NTM price-to-earnings multiple bottomed out around 15.5x, marking a drop of nearly 7x (see chart) from its January peak. By comparison, in March 2020 the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs NTM price-to-earnings ratio hit a low of 13x. The findings would seem to support Kolanovic‚Äôs view that U.S. stocks already priced in a mild recession. His analysis comes after the busiest week of the second-quarter earnings season, with corporate performance holding up surprisingly well considering the U.S. economy has contracted now for two consecutive quarters.

Second Quarter 2022 Results

Total Revenue of $510.6 million, an increase of 27% compared to the second quarter of 2021
Net Income was $26.0 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, an increase of 29% and 25%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2021
EBITDA(1) of $54.3 million, an increase of 33% compared to the second quarter of 2021
Cash and Cash Equivalents totaled $72.9 million at June 30, 2022
Backlog at June 30, 2022 was $1.54 billion, an increase of 3% over December 31, 2021
Combined backlog(2) at June 30, 2022 was $1.73 billion, an increase of 14% over December 31, 2021
For the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company reported net income of $26.0 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, versus $20.1 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, in the second quarter 2021. Revenue increased by 27% over the prior year quarter, with 8% from organic growth and 19% growth generated from the acquired Petillo business. EBITDA increased 33% to $54.3 million in the second quarter of 2022, versus $41.0 million in the prior-year period. Second quarter EBITDA benefited from solid operating income growth from each segment, partially offset by ongoing supply chain and inflation challenges.

CEO Remarks and Outlook

‚ÄúWe are pleased with our strong second quarter performance and continue to feel positive about our position in all of our markets. Our teams have done an amazing job across the organization and continue executing remarkably well in this challenging economic environment,‚Äù stated Joe Cutillo, Sterling‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer.

‚ÄúThe growth in our E-Infrastructure Solutions once again made it our largest segment, and E-Infrastructure and Building Solutions continue representing 89% of our total segment operating income. Our disciplined approach coupled with our continued focus on execution of our strategic objectives resulted in an increase in gross profit of $12.1 million; however, we experienced a decrease in gross margin of sixty basis points to 13.4% from the prior year period driven predominately by inflation and material availability,‚Äù continued Mr. Cutillo.

‚ÄúWith the continued demand for complex site development, we broadened our customer base with industrial and manufacturing opportunities in E-Infrastructure Solutions, we continued experiencing growth in the Phoenix and Houston markets for Building Solutions and we began seeing an increase in infrastructure bill activity in Transportation Solutions.

Material availability and inflation remain a concern in all of our markets; however, we are closely monitoring these developments and we will continue to work with customers to recover the additional material and labor cost. In light of our performance to date, our increased backlog levels and our disciplined culture, we are adjusting our full year 2022 guidance. The mid-point of our guidance would improve our net income by 48%, our revenue by 19% and our EPS by 42% over 2021,‚Äù Mr. Cutillo concluded.

Full Year 2022 Guidance:

Revenue of $1.865 billion to $1.885 billion
Net Income of $90 million to $96 million
EPS of $2.95 to $3.15
EBITDA of $192 million to $202 million",Anybody else on the Sterling (STRL) train?,2022-08-02

stocks,"I understand that there are many factors at play, and companies that have been leveraging debt may be affected by interest rates rising and they may be affected if they see sells slow because their consumers stop buying or they cannot raise prices to keep profit margins steady.  Put that aside.

Say I've bought shares of a small company that produces valuable and likable products and services for which they consistently are able to raise the prices as their costs go up.  They also do not need to borrow any money to keep operations going.  It's just a very simple small company.  1000 shares at $100 each.  They have earnings of about $100 per share.  Raw materials go up, they raise prices.  Their customers pay the higher prices.  Business is good and steady.   Labor costs go up, they raise prices, and their customers pay the higher prices, and business is good and steady.  In this scenario, why should the stock valuation go down OR up?  That said, when I bought the company $100 per share was a fair amount of money, but today $100 has been severely devalued.

stocks,"Why do people waste their time trying to make money from options/trying to pick which stocks will perform well when you can reliably + accurately (60-80%) time which direction SPX will go? No, I'm not selling you some Discord. No, I'm not claiming to be a genius for finding this. I didn't even come up with it.

1. Go to TradingView, look up SPY, set the candles to 5 minutes
2. Go to Indicators -&gt; Community Scripts. Type in ""VWAP/MVWAP/EMA CROSSOVER"". Look for the script by ""derricklaflame"" with 1900+ stars. Add it to your chart.
3. Look at every time it draws ""Short"" + ""Long"" on the graph (the arrows above/below the candle). You can ignore the ""Buy alert / Risky / Wait / Enter Here"" stuff.

The logic of this ""algorithm"" / ""strategy"" is very easy. It's a common fast/slow EMA crossover strategy, with VWAP mixed in. It's 3 boolean checks against 4 input numbers: VWAP, EMA of 7 candles worth of close prices, EMA of 25 candles worth of close prices, and EMA of 21 candles worth of VWAP.

    // input signals
    vwapEma21 = ema(vwap, 21) // ema of 21 candles of vwap
    closeEma7 = ema(close, 7) // ema of 7 candles of close
    closeEma25 = ema(close, 25) // ema of 25 candles of close
    // decisions
    check1 = (vwap &gt;= vwapEma21)
    check2 = (closeEma7 &gt;= vwapEma21)
    check3 = (closeEma25 &gt;= vwapEma21)
    shouldBeLong = check1 == true and check2 == true and check3 == true
    shouldBeShort = shouldBeLong == false

If you pay attention... it doesn't even care about last price directly. Literally irrelevant. You could turn off OHLC candles for this algorithm. No drawing support/resistance/trend lines.

You just wait for this indicator to fire. You should probably ignore the 9:30am alert. You should probably close out your positions by the end of the day and ignore any 3:55pm alerts.

You should probably use limit + stop loss orders to the tune of:

    1. aim for 0.375%-0.5% profit per trade
    2. risk only up to 0.25% loss

You need a margin account to go long without settling issues + go short.

You can also do this with /ES futures which require $11.5k in margin requirement but give you ""exposure"" to 500 shares worth of SPY (which would take closer to $200k of margin requirement).

It backtests extremely well. It works on multiple timeframes (5 minute, 15 minute, 30 minute, 1 hour, 2 hour, 4 hour, 1 day, etc.)

It fired 10 times in the past 10 months on the 1 day timeframe. Of the 10, 80% of them were extremely profitable.

I think it's goofy that people are obsessed with earnings, what the Federal Reserve is going to do next, what direction the market is headed, etc. I've backtested this extensively on QuantConnect. It performs very well during CoVID crash and more. It generates Alpha compared to S&amp;P benchmark and I think the Sharpe ratio I got was like 6+ with an ROI of 20-30% annual.

Let's use an example of $100k today on 250 shares of SPY. It fired short alert at 1:20pm Eastern today at around $410.73. Market got down to about $409.10. $1.63 change, 250 shares, $400 trade, 0.4%

By all means, shit all over this. Poop on it. Tear it to shreds. Call me dumb. I've backtested this, I use it daily. Yes I'm ""dumb"" for bringing public attention to a ""winning"" strategy because ""if it gets too crowded, it may fail to work"". But I want to collaborate with some smart people and see what they think.

1. I bought 100 shares of stock XYZ for $20 per share.
2. I later bought 50 shares more of stock XYZ for $30 per share.
3. I sell to open a Call option for XYZ at strike of $25 when the stock price at the time is $21 which makes me $15 for the sale of the call.
4. Expiration date comes around and the call is now ITM since XYZ is now selling at $27. The call gets exercised!

My question about this example is, if some of the assigned 100 shares are from the pool i bought at $30 per share does that mean I must refrain from buying any more XYZ shares for 30 days to avoid wash sale?

Seeing some of the news from the fed and economists that it seems the inflation will remain high and will keep raising rates until inflation goes down it seems that the nov ibond rate will be about the same, right? 

Some analysts say by 2023 the fed will lower rates as inflation gets under control. Which might mean the ibond rates goes lower to around 7% , right?

Or can the ibond rate go above 10% in Nov and then in may 23, the rates go way down?

On one side , the recession might trigger inflation to go down abruptly as more people get fired, and supply chain/energy/war subside.
On the other side maybe baby boomers, who many retired during covid , come back to work and giving too much employment and therefore inflation goes up.

stocks,"A key barometer of American factories fell to a 25-month low of 52.8% in July in a sign of creeping weakness in the U.S. economy. The good news? Inflation pressures eased. The Institute for Supply Management‚Äôs closely followed manufacturing gauge dipped from 53% in June, in no small part due to another decline in new orders. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast the index to total 52.1%. The closely followed report is viewed as a window into the health of the U.S. economy.

While any number above 50% signifies growth, the latest reading was the weakest since June 2020. The index has also declined three months in a row for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. The silver lining in the report was some relief from inflation. Companies are still paying higher prices for supplies, but a gauge of inflation sank to a nearly two-year low. It will take some time before the economy begins to benefit, however. The rate of inflation has jumped 9.1% in the past year, according to a popular index that tracks the cost of living. Problems getting supplies also continued to clear up. Supply shortages have played a big role in the worst U.S. outbreak of inflation in almost 41 years.

**Big picture:** The U.S. economy has slowed since the end of last year due to soaring inflation, rising interest rates and the end of government stimulus. Gross domestic product, the official scorecard for the economy, has fallen two quarters in a row, meeting an old but informal definition of recession. While factories are still running close to full tilt, business has slowed and it could get worse in the months ahead as a decline in orders suggests. New orders reflect future sales.

In some cases, customers over-ordered and are waiting to sell the products they have on hand. They are also worried about a recession. ‚ÄúOur markets are still holding up; however, I believe a slowdown is coming,‚Äù a top executive at a company that makes metal parts told ISM. ‚ÄúWe are cautious about going out too far with orders.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

**Key details:** The index of new orders slid 1.2 points to 48%. That‚Äôs the lowest level since May 2020.

The production barometer dropped 1.4 points to 53.5%. The employment gauge rose 2.6 points to 49.9%. Most manufacturers are still trying to hire, Fiore said, in a positive sign for the economy. The prices index, a measure of inflation, sank 18.5 points to 60%, the lowest level in almost two years. Most of the decline reflected lower energy prices. Looking ahead: ‚ÄúThe broad slowdown in the economy is apparent in the manufacturing sector as well,‚Äù said chief investment office Jim Baird of Plante Moran Financial Advisors. ‚ÄúStill, conditions are modestly expansionary, a welcome sign amid the pervasive negativity on the heels of last week‚Äôs GDP report.‚Äù

**Market reaction:** The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, 0.29% and S&amp;P 500 SPX, 0.27% fell slightly in Monday trades. The losses were extended after the ISM report.

&gt; Stock futures fell Monday following the market‚Äôs best month since 2020 as investors look ahead to another week of key earnings reports and economic data.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded 22 points lower, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures shed around 0.2% along with Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
&gt; On Friday, all major indexes gained, posting winning weeks and capping off the best month of the year so far and then some. The Dow gained 6.7% in July, while the S&amp;P 500 added 9.1%. The Nasdaq Composite rose 12.4% as investors rushed into the tech stocks beaten up the most during this bear market. For each index, July‚Äôs performances were the best since 2020.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe are seeing a relief rally in the stock market, as pessimism reached extreme levels, and as longer-term interest rates have been coming back down,‚Äù said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe believe the rally will last until later in the summer, but as stock prices rebound and it becomes increasingly clear that we are headed for a more typical recession (e.g. one with higher unemployment and nominal GDP dropping close to zero or negative), markets will again have another selloff,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBut until that time, enjoy the rally as it‚Äôs likely catching a lot of people off guard.‚Äù
*****
&gt; This week, investors have more economic data and company earnings to digest. On Monday, companies such as Activision Blizzard, Devon Energy, Loews and more report earnings. Later in the week Uber, Caterpillar, Starbucks, Eli Lilly, Amgen and others also have scheduled reports.
*****
&gt; In addition, the Friday nonfarm payrolls report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics will give more insight into the strong labor market. So far this year, the solid growth of jobs has prompted economists to say the U.S. is currently not in a recession, even with two consecutive quarters of negative GDP.

stocks,"While the stock market has enjoyed an impressive run of late, the party could end when the next inflation result comes out in early August. The S&amp;P 500 has gained 13% since hitting its lowest close of the year in mid-June, mounting a broad rally that features more than just a handful of stocks. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 16% from its mid-June low, and the Russell 2000 index of stocks with smaller market capitalizations has risen 14%. 

The main force behind that has been investors‚Äô view that the Federal Reserve will begin to slow down the sharp increases in interest rates it has been rolling out as it seeks to lower the rate of inflation by curbing economic demand. While the Fed will likely raise its target for the benchmark lending rate at its next few policy-setting meetings, the probability that it lifts the rate to above 3.5% by February has gone down to 17% from a 44% chance a month ago, according to CME Group data. The bank now aims to keep the benchmark, the fed-funds rate, at 2.25%-2.5%, up from near zero at the start of the year.

Contributing to that more optimistic view about rates are signs in two key places that the rate of inflation has already peaked. Commodity prices are now way down, with West Texas Intermediate crude off about 14% since the start of June, and copper down about 16%. Not only is oil part of the consumer price index basket, but it is possible that falling commodity prices reflect a decline in demand across the economy. Another indication that prices could be cooling off appeared in the S&amp;P Global U.S. Services Purchasing Managers Index, a measure of activity in the services sector. That fell to 47 in July, while anything below 50 represents a contraction in activity. If activity is diminishing, demand would fall as well, bringing prices down. 

Markets will get to see whether that optimistic thesis holds water when the consumer price index is released on Aug. 10. Economists are looking for the CPI to have gained 8.8% year over year in July, which would be below the 9.1% seen for June. For stocks to keep rising, the market needs to see that inflation is in fact cooling down. If the result is worse than expected, expectations that the Fed will slow down its rate increases could fade away, sending the stock market tumbling. 

‚ÄúThe Fed has to be concerned that inflation is becoming more entrenched and they are going to need to remain aggressive in raising interest rates,‚Äù wrote Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. ‚ÄúWe believe the rally will last until later in the summer. Markets will again have another selloff.‚Äù Others agree. ‚Äú\[Stock\] gains are now data dependent,‚Äù wrote Julian Emanuel, equity strategist at Evercore.

stocks," Last week, Ranpack Holdings (PACK) plunged 23% in response to its Q2 earnings report. The decline completes an epic round-trip that saw the stock hit $41 in 2021 only to plunge to $5 at the close on Friday.

But the return to 2019 lows on its own doesn‚Äôt make the stock a buying opportunity. Nor is the chart that outlandish in the context of pandemic winners. Indeed, its chart looks similar to that of one of the biggest pandemic winners (and post-pandemic losers), Peloton Interactive (PTON).

The broad risk for PACK stock is that it winds up looking even more like PTON, which has not only round-tripped but fallen well below pre-pandemic levels. It‚Äôs not impossible that PACK follows a similar pattern. Ranpak‚Äôs Q2 earnings were ugly. Leverage is significant, and a potential mid-term concern.

With those caveats, however, this is an intriguing story. The long-term case for Ranpak isn‚Äôt broken. Balance sheet risk seems manageable. Valuation is attractive in a historical context. Ranpak isn‚Äôt what investors believed it was a year ago, certainly ‚Äî but at $5 it doesn‚Äôt have to be.

**Ranpak At A Glance**

Founded in 1972, Ranpak manufactures systems which in turn are used to create paper-based packaging for protection during shipping, as well as automated solutions for both packaging and box-sizing. The systems ‚Äî 136,500 at the end of Q2 ‚Äî mostly are leased out to end users for a small fee; through a razor and blade model. Ranpack then profits from delivering the paper consumables. The company has leading market share in paper-based packaging.

That packaging falls into three categories. Void-fill, as the name suggests, uses paper to fill empty space within a box, limiting movement of and damage to objects in transit. Cushioning products are created by crimping paper to create air bubbles. Wrapping products include paper mesh as well as cold chain products, used for refrigerated transport. In 2021, void-fill drove \~40% of revenue, cushioning \~42%, and wrapping \~14%, with the remainder coming from automated equipment and accessories.

Major customers include Amazon.com (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), Ikea, and many more; overall, Ranpack has end users in some 50 countries. 38% of 2021 revenue came from North America, 12% from Asia/EMEA, and ‚Äî notably ‚Äî half from Europe.

Ranpack went public in 2019 via merger. JS Capital, run by Jonathan Soros, son of George, owns 37.5% of the company.

**The High Level Bull Case**

That description highlights two core pillars of the long-term bull case. Ranpak is an obvious play on e-commerce growth; most readers no doubt have encountered its packaging in the wild. It‚Äôs also a play on sustainability, given both the ability of its packaging to be recycled (unlike, for example, styrofoam), and the fact that recycled materials are used in its consumables (over half of raw supply is recycled paper).

This also has been an awfully good business over time, as growth has been consistent, if not quite spectacular. EBITDA margins cleared 30% in 2021, and conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow historically was rather strong.

**Pandemic Rollercoaster**

Unsurprisingly, that bull case was greeted with optimism after the novel coronavirus pandemic hit. E-commerce growth led machine placements to rise double-digits in both 2020 and 2021. Last year, revenue increased 28.7% (26.3% on a constant-currency basis), with Adjusted EBITDA margins essentially flat. PACK stock ended 2019 at $8.15, below its $10 merger price; at the early 2021 peak the stock had more than quintupled.

Again, this was a classic pandemic winner. And, like so many pandemic winners, 2022 has been rough for both the business and the stock.

In the Q4 release in February, Ranpak [gave constant-currency guidance](https://ir.ranpak.com/news/news-details/2022/Ranpak-Holdings-Corp.-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx) for revenue growth of 13% to 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $128 to $132 million (+9% to +12%). After Q1, Ranpak moved to the lower end of the top-line outlook, and cut the midpoint of its EBITDA guidance by about 10%.

Following Thursday‚Äôs report, however, the news got much worse. Ranpak now sees sales declining even in constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA now is pointed to $75 to $85 million ‚Äî but even that understates the case. As an analyst pointed out on the call, currency effects (notably the weaker euro) suggest a \~$5 million hit.

As reported, then, Adjusted EBITDA is guided down about one-third year-over-year. Even assuming that guidance is hit ‚Äî and after the last two quarters, investors would be forgiven for not wanting to assume *anything* ‚Äî Ranpak should close the year with a net leverage ratio over 4x. At the midpoint of guidance, shares trade at almost 10x EV/EBITDA, which given the growth profile hardly seems like an attractive multiple.

**Everything Is Going Wrong**

It‚Äôs worth putting 2022 in context. The pandemic clearly is a factor in results so far this year. Consumer spending has pivoted from buying goods in 2020-2021 to buying travel and services in 2022. Ranpak management has been firm after both Q1 and Q2 (particularly after Q2) in emphasizing that customers aren‚Äôt moving to competitors, or to plastic alternatives. Rather, there simply aren‚Äôt the volumes moving through factories, which in turn means there aren‚Äôt the volumes going through Ranpak machines. Comparisons in the first half were particularly challenging as well.

But this isn‚Äôt just a case of customers being over-inventoried amid changing end consumer behavior. An ERP (enterprise resource planning) implementation in Q1 led to delayed price increases and potentially some lost revenue, with modest effects lingering into Q2. Kraft paper prices have soared, and though Ranpak has taken some pricing, it‚Äôs chosen to sacrifice some margin as well given the struggles of its own customers. Input costs hit gross margins by 810 basis points in Q2, per the earnings call, with greater inflation outside the U.S. even excluding currency.

Of course, outside the U.S. inflation isn‚Äôt the biggest problem. It‚Äôs the economy. The energy crisis in Europe is exacerbating pandemic effects, and pressuring margins. Chief executive officer Omar Asali said on the Q2 call that ‚Äúfrankly, a big part of our cautious outlook and guidance, is being driven by a number of things we‚Äôre seeing out of Europe.‚Äù Again, given that the Continent accounted for half of revenue last year, that‚Äôs no surprise.

**Taking The Long View**

It‚Äôs worth taking a step back, however, and understanding that this is an unprecedented environment for Ranpack. Literally. Asali said (going back even to when the company was private) it had never seen the increases in input costs borne over the past 18 months.

Nothing is working in Ranpak‚Äôs favor right now. Comparisons are difficult, consumer demand has been pulled forward, Europe is in trouble, and input costs are soaring. These negative trends shouldn‚Äôt be all occurring at the same time; most notably, higher costs and macro problems should be close to mutually exclusive. (Indeed, as Ranpak noted at the time the merger was announced, despite lower revenue, Adjusted EBITDA actually increased year-over-year in 2009, in part due to lower kraft prices.)

From that understanding, two points flow. The first is that the long-term case isn‚Äôt broken by these largely short-term factors. The demand for non-plastic options from both consumers and, more importantly, governments isn‚Äôt going anywhere.

The plunge in e-commerce stocks in 2022 isn‚Äôt being driven by a reduction in the long-term outlook for the category. Rather, it‚Äôs a realization that 2021 did not, as hoped, represent a new base for growth.

Sustainable packaging for e-commerce (one-third of 2021 revenue) is still a growth market. The stronger dollar and higher kraft costs both may persist, but Ranpak (and its customers) can adapt. European economic weakness is a worry, certainly, but it‚Äôs not as if the Continent was booming in the first two decades of this century, during which time Renpak roughly tripled its sales.

The second is that, in the context of an absolutely terrible year, PACK stock is not terribly expensive. 9.5x EBITDA[1](https://www.overlookedalpha.com/p/ranpak-holdings-the-case-for-a-busted#footnote-1) is not an outlandish multiple; PACK stock closed 2019 at a slightly higher valuation (based on full-year 2019 results). The news gets a bit tougher looking to free cash flow, as cash interest (\~$20 million) and capex (\~$50 million) will eat up pretty much all of this year‚Äôs EBITDA. But capex is a bit elevated at the moment owing to technology investments, and it only takes a return to $100 million or so to get P/FCF here relatively reasonable. Ranpak guided for [$91 million to $96 million](https://ir.ranpak.com/news/news-details/2020/Ranpak-Holdings-Corp-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2019-Financial-Results/default.aspx) in 2020, before the impact of the pandemic became clear.

**Valuation**

And, before the impact of the pandemic became clear, PACK was trading just shy of $8. As far as we know, nothing has really changed. E-commerce growth has continued and sustainability demands have grown. Profit margins admittedly have weakened markedly, but there are levers to pull on that front, and simply catching up to price/cost will provide a boost.

This is still a business with strong tailwinds and mid-20s EBITDA margins as is. It‚Äôs not that difficult to model a double. A low double-digit multiple to $110 million in EBITDA should do the trick. That same model suggests a low 20s multiple to free cash flow, which too isn‚Äôt unreasonable if and when some degree of normalcy returns.

That rough model highlights the broad bull case here: this, too, will pass. Management will adapt, comparisons will ease, consumer behaviors will normalize. At that point, Ranpak should be able to get back to its past growth trend ‚Äî with a potential upfront boost off a period of what appear to be record-low EBITDA margins. Even back in 2017 and 2018, Ranpak was able to drive $20 million-plus in free cash flow; the current price suggests a 20x multiple to that performance, hardly a high bar to clear in a more normalized environment.

Put simply, $40-plus in 2021 was the wrong price, but that doesn‚Äôt mean $5 is the right one.

**Mind The Risks**

Again, there are risks here, and it‚Äôs possible a mid-term double isn‚Äôt quite the reward required for those risks. A lower price would help on that front, and the short-term risk is that a lower price indeed arrives. Friday‚Äôs 6% bounce does not mean that the knife has stopped falling. We‚Äôve been loud and consistent in our belief that there‚Äôs another leg down coming for the broad market, and PACK likely would outpace broader declines in that scenario.

But it‚Äôs possible we‚Äôre wrong on that front or that readers believe we‚Äôre wrong. It‚Äôs also possible that PACK fills the gap, particularly if this recent rally continues (as it may well do, particularly with the Fed hike in the rearview mirror).

External factors aside, the key risk here is that management is wrong in saying that the competitive environment hasn‚Äôt changed. That does seem unlikely. There‚Äôs not a ton of benefit in switching from Ranpak‚Äôs paper-based products to plastics, given higher oil prices have raised prices on that side of the business as well. The strong dollar ostensibly would open the door to a competitor in Europe, but volatile and high energy prices would undercut that advantage.

All told, it seems like at some point, the storm will pass and PACK stock will get back to being what it was in the past. What makes the stock intriguing at $5 is that ‚Äúthe past‚Äù only needs to be 2018, not 2021.

I own BABA and have a number of questions around this de-listing. I hope it is appropriate for this sub (since it is stocks) and hoping this will help anyone else in my shoes.

1. When a company is de-listed from a stock exchange does it's value fall to zero?
2. China has announced that BABA may potentially have a dual-primary listing in HK? What are the implications? Can i simply transfer my shares from US to HK? (I have trading permissions on  HKEX)
3. Since the US stock (BABA) is an ADR and the HK stock (9988) is a secondary listing, are there any implications for this transfer or is it as simple as moving from one exchange to the other by the broker(like IBKR)?
4. The current BABA price is USD 89. The current 9988 price in HKEX is 89 HKD. However, 1 USD = 7.85 HKD. If i have 100 BABA shares do they get transferred as 100 shares of 9988 or will FX be taken into account? (If FX is not taken into account, then the value of my shares will reduce by 7.85 since the price is roughly equal)

Like a lot of BABA shareholders (bagholders?) i am very worried and want to know the implications before i decide to cut my losses and sell it off. The other option is to not look at news and HODL!!! or play the ""chicken"" game but this is a good opportunity to learn about de-listing and share transfer.

stocks,"&gt;We don't see the world as it is, we see it as we are.

&gt;-Anais Nin

The future is fraught with uncertainty, and no one has a crystal ball.  We are all trying to predict what the Fed does based upon our own personal biases, of which we all have many.  Our forecasts probably say way more about our positions than they do the future.  And while these biases are impossible to remove entirely, I believe that on the balance, the current Fed fundamentally leans dovish.

They like growing the economy.  And they really don't like job losses or economic slack.  When making a decision, they rather err by making too many jobs than too little.

While it's obvious now that price stability is their top priority, I believe they still care a lot about unemployment and will genuinely do the absolute best they can to achieve a soft-landing.

Whether they can successfully do that is very much up for debate but past actions continually support that they tilt dovish.

* 2016 rate hike cycle was very gentle.  Extremely well-telegraphed, minimal surprises.
* Paused QT without making a significant dent in the balance sheet.
* Clear willingness to take dramatic and unprecedented steps when presented with a crisis, like in Covid.
* Inflation evidence was building fairly strongly way before the commodities crisis spurred by the Ukraine war.  CPI was almost 8% without the invasion.
* They probably could have started to unwind sooner, many were calling for it but they were quite resolute despite pressure.

I just made orders to sell everything in my portfolio on monday so that I can keep the gains I made this month. I basically dont know if I should keep some in and only lose a little or just sell them all.

stocks,"**Original thesis:**

* **Quick introduction**: I've been an investor in ROKU since **2020** right before HBO Max made a deal to be available on ROKU. I've invested **over $100K** into the company via dollar cost average and have lost **+60%** of my investment due to poor stock performance.
* **Active accounts**: More people are going to cut the cord because cable is more expensive &amp; less flexible than streaming. Along with international expansion, this would have helped ROKU add **+10m** active accounts per a year.
* **Average revenue per user**: Shift of advertising dollars from Linear TV to Streaming TV. In 2020, **40%** of U.S. TV time was streamed but only **13%** of TV ad budgets were spent on streaming. This would have helped average revenue per user (*ARPU*) as advertisers &amp; their dollars followed potential customers to close the gap and help ROKU grow revenue by **30% - 40%** on an annual basis.
* **Competitive positioning**: Market leader with **+38%** of U.S. streaming players &amp; **+33%** of U.S. smart TVs has their operating system. Impressive that they have maintained a competitive lead for over a decade against the largest tech companies in the world including Amazon, Google, Apple, Samsung, and LG. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What has changed from my past thesis that's negative:**

* **Active Accounts will be lower-than-expected**: ROKU pulled forward multiple years of customer growth during the COVID pandemic as people were stuck at home &amp; needed a smart TV. So the company is closer to maturity as it penetrated most of its TAM especially in the U.S. My expectation for active account growth is to be **5m - 8m** per year, which will primarily be low-value accounts from their international expansion that have a lower monetization value along with a few high-value U.S. accounts that will be acquired as households continue to leave cable &amp; defections from competition.
* **More cyclical than I thought**: I thought that ROKU would enjoy a **30% - 40%** revenue CAGR as advertising dollars shift from linear TV to streaming TV. But, ROKU just withdrew it's guidance for **35% y/y** revenue growth in FY '22 and will most likely only grow in the **high-teens** as advertisers pull back on marketing spend in response to the economy.
* **OneView &amp; the dynamic programmatic ads is overrated**: They are immaterial to the business and it's best to focus on the fundamental blocks for the company today. ROKU primarily gets most of their advertising dollars from the scatter market and a little from upfronts. The ads will work similarly as linear TV.  I'm not going to get distracted by the other parts of the business.

&amp;#x200B;

**What has changed from my past thesis that's positive:**

* **Netflix &amp; other streaming players offering an AVOD option**: My base case was that Netflix &amp; most of the larger streaming apps would offer an ad-free subscription. But, Netflix &amp; Disney + are now more open-minded to an AVOD (*advertising video on demand option*), which may attract more households to leave cable because they can now better afford subscriptions since the AVOD options generally are priced at a 25% - 50% discount. This provides a little relief to my outlook for ROKU's active account growth, but I'm more excited this will help boost my outlook for ROKU's ARPU since ROKU gets a **20% - 30%** share of advertising.
* **Sports being offered on streaming**: Three items I see holding back households from leaving cable: it would be too expensive to bundle multiple streaming apps to watch all of the content a household wants, no sports, and no news. The AVOD options from streaming apps addresses point 1 while streaming apps are also addressing point 2.  NFL, NBA, MLB, and MLS are now available to be streamed that I didn't expect before especially given the lucrative deals all of these leagues  originally signed to be on linear TV.
* **IDFA, digital privacy changes from Apple, and upcoming for Google**: I didn't expect this to happen. This is making it really difficult for advertisers to efficiently target customers that rely on tracking customers based on their iPhone activity. I expect Google to do something similar for Android &amp; Chrome. ROKU stands to benefit not only from linear TV ad dollars shifting to streaming, but also ad dollars from mobile as advertisers look for an effective option to target customers.

&amp;#x200B;

**What hasn't changed from my past thesis:**

* **Shift from cable to streaming**: **47.6%** of U.S. households stream and is expected to be **57.6%** by 2026
* **Shift of advertising dollars from Linear TV to Streaming TV: 50%** of U.S. TV time is streamed, but only **22%** of TV ad budgets is spent on streaming. That gap will need to close as advertisers need to follow where the customers are at.
* **Competitive positioning**: ROKU has maintained a competitive lead for over a decade against the largest tech companies in the world including Amazon, Google, Apple, Samsung, and LG. If these companies couldn't topple ROKU for over a decade and ROKU hasn't slipped in their product roadmap, how can one seriously expect them to change that dynamic?

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I'm still holding and I may buy more:**

* **Balancing my original thesis against things that have changed**: Most of my original thesis **remains**, but has been **weakened** due to me overestimating customer growth after the pandemic, the secular resilience of the company, and the impact of initiatives that are a small part of their business. There are a few new items like tailwinds from AVOD streaming options, sports, and IDFA tailwinds. But on a net-net, my thesis has been the weakened and ROKU's stock already reflects that by going from the **high $400s to the $60s**.
* **TINA**: I can't think of many stocks that will generate strong shareholder value in a challenging stock market &amp; macro environment. **There is no alternative** so I figured how about I stay &amp; invest in a beaten down company and ROKU's stock will probably rise a lot faster than other stocks when the environment improves since it's a smaller company, more sensitive to an improving economy given the reliance on advertising spend, ROKU is not losing to competitors, and streaming TV is not losing to other industries.
* **Negative stock perception**: The recent earnings call was horrible for ROKU and analysts across Wall Street has responded with downgrades including Bank of America with a **$55** price target. I find it difficult to find good opportunities in stocks that everyone crowds around and I'm hoping to take advantage of the poor sentiment today, ROKU continuing to execute with all of the tailwinds in streaming TV industry, and eventually ROKU's stock will go up when the economy &amp; advertising spend improves
* **Potential acquisition target if things get really bad**: ROKU is the #1 TV operating system and over 60m accounts. The company's market cap is over **$8 billion**, so it's a feasible &amp; attractive acquisition target for a big tech company that wants to be the gatekeeper in the streaming TV ecosystem. I expect ROKU to weather the tough economy, keep executing, and continue operating as an independent company. But, it makes me comfortable that ROKU does a really good job at its niche and many companies will find what ROKU does is attractive if an acquisition is potentially the best exit option for investors.",Reevaluating my thesis on ROKU: What I got wrong and why I'm still holding,2022-07-31

I'm a Bogglehead, for the most part, that got a bit too invested in the rise in Tech in 2020 and 2021. I bought quite a bit of SE and SQ and am now down roughly 65% in each position. 

Rather than wait for these stocks to get back to my cost basis price, I had a thought to sell and invest the remainder into more concrete companies (what some are calling ""value Tech"") like AAPL, MSFT, or GOOG. I have exposure in each of these already via my ETFs, but thought that a direct position might help accelerate returns on what's been lost with SE and SQ.

Only thing is, to regain losses, AAPL, MSFT, or GOOG have to rise to substantial levels, basically becoming $4T companies.

Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, suggested on Friday that markets had gotten ahead of themselves in anticipating that the central bank ‚Äî which has been raising interest rates swiftly this year ‚Äî would soon begin to back off.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised by markets‚Äô interpretation,‚Äù Mr. Kashkari said in an interview. ‚ÄúThe committee is united in our determination to get inflation back down to 2 percent, and I think we‚Äôre going to continue to do what we need to do until we are convinced that inflation is well on its way back down to 2 percent ‚Äî and we are a long way away from that.‚Äù

Given that fact, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said policymakers would now set rates meeting by meeting rather than committing to a broad plan well in advance. Investors took that as a sign that the central bank was likely to slow rate moves sharply in the coming months as the economy slows. In fact, bond market pricing suggests that investors think officials may even begin to cut interest rates next year.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the bond market is looking at in reaching that conclusion,‚Äù Mr. Kashkari said, adding that the bar would be ‚Äúvery, very high‚Äù to lower rates.

stocks,"I have a question for y‚Äôall, about DCAing when a stock is up. So I bought into a lot of stocks at a really high price, between September and December of last year.

I‚Äôve since DCA‚Äôd down to like $820 or something, so I‚Äôm actually up now. 


This is the same with many other stocks I own and crypto. I buy every day. So my question is now, as the market has kinda baby bounced back a bit.

stocks,"So first of all I know that time in the market beats timing the market and dollar cost averaging is the way to go when it comes to long term investing ( that is what I am doing too). However, just for discussion, I think this is a bear market really and I think there is more pain ahead and this is the reasoning: 
- Right now investors are pricing in the fact that inflation has peaked and fed will start lowering interest rates in 2023. The problem with this is that even though gas prices have fallen a bit ( still not low as crude oil is close to $100 a barrel and natural gas is still higher than before ), inflation will still come very high. Let's say that inflation peaked at 9.1%, do we feel good if it will be 6-8% in the next coming months ? I personally do not think that having fed funds rates at around 3.2% will bring down inflation to the targeted area of 2 or even 3 %. Therefore, FED will be forced to keep raising rates even more than what is expected right now. The fact that also unemployment is so low is a nice cushion for them to keep fighting inflation and raise rates. IMO, once we start seeing the news of inflation being still high and FED being more aggresive, the market will start dropping making a new low or at least retesting the $360 area.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 1st, 2022.

# **Stocks rally for a third day to cap a winning week, major averages post best month since 2020 - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/28/stock-market-news-updates-open-to-close-future.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks climbed for a third consecutive session on Friday as investors digested strong tech earnings and looked past concerns about high inflation and a recessionary environment.
*****
&gt; All of the major averages rose to a winning week and their best month of 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 315.50 points, or nearly 1%, to 32,845.13. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 1.4% to 4,130.29, and the Nasdaq Composite added about 1.9% to end the day at 12,390.69.
*****
&gt; For the week, the Dow ended higher by nearly 3%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite gained about 4.3% and 4.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Dow rose to a 6.7% gain for July. The S&amp;P 500 added 9.1% for the month. The Nasdaq Composite, while still in bear market territory, is up roughly 12.4%. Those were the biggest monthly gains for all three indexes since 2020.
*****
&gt; That performance is a stark contrast from the previous six months when stocks tumbled to their June bear market levels. The market reversed as investors‚Äô fears about the aggressive pacing of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate increases started to wane and the idea that inflation has perhaps peaked began to settle in.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúStarting from a position of depressed sentiment and bearish positioning was an asset, but the bigger picture was a subtle shift in inflation and inflation expectations, and thus the market‚Äôs expectation for the Fed‚Äôs path,‚Äù said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. ‚ÄúOf late, corporate earnings resilience has only added to the bull case and likely put a near-term floor under equity markets.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Still, some have remained worried about inflation levels with Russia‚Äôs ongoing war on Ukraine and the possibility that markets could turn lower again. On Friday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that June‚Äôs personal consumption expenditures index climbed 6.8% on a 12-month basis. This inflation indicator, which is watched closely by the Fed, hit its highest level since January 1982.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThis may just prove to be a bear market rally in the end ‚Äì they are very common during longer bear markets ‚Äì but the combination of rate reprieve, bearish sentiment and positioning, and corporate and consumer resilience in the face of inflation has been enough to spark a rally in risk assets,‚Äù Mayfield said.
*****
&gt; On Friday, investors also got the final reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, which came in at 51.5 for July. That‚Äôs a slight improvement over the preliminary reading and up from the June all-time low of 50.
*****
&gt; # Big Tech earnings lift indexes
&gt; Nevertheless, gains from two of the market‚Äôs biggest stocks led the major averages higher. Amazon shares popped nearly 10.4% after the e-commerce giant reported stronger-than-expected sales for the previous quarter, while Apple climbed 3.2% after posting better-than-expected iPhone revenue.
*****
&gt; Chevron and Exxon Mobil also posted better-than-anticipated results for the previous quarter, sending their shares higher by 8.9% and 4.6%, respectively.
*****
&gt; However, the latest batch of corporate results has been mixed.
*****
&gt; Shares of Roku sank about 23.1% after the company missed estimates and warned of a slowdown in advertising. Chipmaker Intel dropped nearly 8.6% after its quarterly results fell short of expectations.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe market is taking a lot of comfort in the mixed earnings season because the concern was that it was not going to be mixed, that it would be more uniformly negative,‚Äù said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management. ‚ÄúThat that didn‚Äôt happen allowed investors to realize that a major implication of all the risk certainties now is that we‚Äôre going to see a lot more dispersion at the individual company level.‚Äù
*****
&gt; For example, while Intel lowered its full-year expectations, Microsoft issued a rosy income forecast for the year ahead. While Walmart cut its profit outlook, Amazon gave upbeat guidance.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúYou think that their fortunes are tied together pretty closely, but you see one struggling a bit more than the other,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFrom one standpoint, that‚Äôs not great ‚Äì it creates some uncertainty and risk around individual companies ‚Äì but it‚Äôs also comforting that it‚Äôs not uniformly negative and some companies are able to manage costs, grow revenues and maintain profit margins better.‚Äù
*****
&gt; More than half of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported earnings, with 72% of those names beating expectations, FactSet data shows.
*****
&gt; The week‚Äôs gains come after investors shook off a three-quarters of a percentage point hike from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and a negative GDP reading on Thursday.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe market is taking on a hope that slowing economic growth is going to result in a more dovish Fed moving forward, even if it‚Äôs a little further out. So it would make sense to me that weaker rates expectations moving forward would result in a little buoyancy in the equity markets,‚Äù said Lauren Goodwin, economist and portfolio strategist of New York Life Investments.
*****
&gt; However, Goodwin cautioned that the unusual economic environment and the long period before the next Fed meeting make it difficult to predict the central bank‚Äôs path from here.
*****
&gt; Ma agreed, saying the extent to which the market has looked past some unfavorable data points is ‚Äúimpressive‚Äù but that current optimism shouldn‚Äôt be taken for granted.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a residual effect of how negative the market was coming in to the month,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe market psychology comes and goes in waves and in the current environment, those waves are very much compressed, given all the uncertainty in the environment. It could be the case that some relatively modest data next week changes the market‚Äôs focus and narrative that persisted throughout much of July.‚Äù

&gt; # Fed Chair Powell: The Comeback Kid

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 1% on each of the last four Fed Days going back to March. The March meeting was the first rate hike of the Fed's current tightening cycle, and every meeting since then has seen a hike of at least 50 basis points. Each time, the S&amp;P surged on the day of the hike.

&gt; The recent equity market strength on Fed Days is a new trend. Market performance on Fed Days during Powell's first few years at the helm was notoriously weak. Below we show the S&amp;P 500's average intraday performance on Fed Days by Fed chair since 1994 when policy changes first started being announced on the same day as the meeting. For Chair Powell, we show the S&amp;P's average performance on Fed Days during his tenure only through July 2021. At the time a year ago, Powell Fed Days were by far the worst of any Fed chair, and the market typically plunged into the close after the 2 PM ET announcement.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-Powell-1a.png))**

&gt; What a difference a year makes. Below we show the S&amp;P's average intraday performance on Fed Days by Fed chair updated through the most recent FOMC meeting this week. Whereas Powell Fed Days were by far the worst for the market at this time last year, they're now the second best behind only Bernanke Fed Days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-Powell-1b.png))**

&gt; To highlight the improvement in the market response to Fed Chair Powell another way, below we show the full-day percentage change of the S&amp;P 500 on Fed Days during Powell's tenure as well as how the cumulative averages have evolved for both the full-day change and performance from 2:30 PM ET through the close (encapsulating the market response to the presser, or the chair more directly).

&gt; As you can see, the S&amp;P was extremely weak on Powell Fed Days early on during his tenure, but over the last year, the market has reacted extremely positively. Seven of the last eight Powell Fed Days have seen positive moves for the S&amp;P, with the last four all seeing gains of more than 1%.

&gt; # Typical August Trading: Usually a Tepid Month

&gt; Money flows from harvesting once made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best DJIA month from 1901 to 1951. However since then and even more recently, over the last 21-years, August has been a disappointing month. The first eight or nine trading days have historically been weak with the major indexes shedding around 0.4% to 1.2%. This weakness is then followed by a brief mid-month rally that typically lasts until the 13th trading day. From there until late month the indexes have tended to wander sideways to lower before springing back to life ahead of month‚Äôs end.

&gt; # August‚Äôs First Trading Day Weakest of All

&gt; On page 90 of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac 2022, it is shown that the first trading days of each month combined have produced an outsized share of the market‚Äôs overall gains. However, the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2022 Almanac. In the upcoming 2023 edition of the Almanac August‚Äôs first trading day is still the worst. In the past 24 years DJIA has risen just 36.4% (up 8, down 16) of the time on the first trading day of August. Several sizable gains in those up years, have mitigated the average first day percent change, but the median performance is a more sizable loss. Over the past 11 years, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have both declined 8 times.

&gt; # Worst Year for Sentiment On Record

&gt; Bullish sentiment measured by the weekly AAII survey has been a series of back and forth moves over the past several weeks. After reaching the highest level in over a month last week, bullish sentiment fell back down to 27.7%. Even with that decline, bullish sentiment has now managed to hold above 25% for at least three weeks in a row for the first time since the start of the year. We also must note, that the AAII survey collects data from Thursday at 12:01 AM through Wednesday 11:59 PM meaning any boost to sentiment from yesterday's FOMC post-meeting rally will not necessarily be fully captured in this report.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Whereas bullish sentiment has had its fair share of back and forth moves, bearish sentiment has more consistently fallen with this week being the third sequential decline in a row. Now at 40%, bearish sentiment is at the lowest level since the first week of June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Given the drop in bulls was slightly smaller than that of bears this week, the bull-bear spread continued to move in a less negative direction. However, in spite of any improvement, this week was the 17th negative reading in a row as that streak remains the third longest on record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-AAII-3a-1.png))**

&gt; Not only have bears outnumbered bulls for 17 straight weeks, but there has actually only been one week this year (the final week of March) in which that was not the case. As a result, this year is on pace to have averaged the lowest levels of bullish sentiment and the highest levels of bearish sentiment of any year in the survey's history.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-AAII-3b.png))**

&gt; With both bulls and bears lower in the most recent survey, neutral sentiment picked up the difference rising to 32.2%. That is the most elevated reading since April and back into the middle of the post-pandemic range.

&gt; # Big Revision in Claims

&gt; Initial jobless claims continue to disappoint. Although this week's release technically fell down to 256K, it was from a 10K upwardly revised number of 261K last week. Both this week and last's readings are the highest since the fall and would also mark the highest readings since the fall of 2017 outside of the historically elevated readings of the pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; The pandemic was a volatile time period for jobless claims data as readings rose into the millions. As such, revisions over the past couple of years have gotten historically large in turn, albeit less so over the past year. Although it may not sound like much, last week's 10K revision was actually sizable. It was the largest revision since the week of July 4th last year, and prior to the pandemic, the week before Christmas in 2012 was the last time there was a double-digit revision.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-Claims-2a.png))**

&gt; In his post meeting presser, Fed Chair Powell mentioned how the rise in initial jobless claims may be seasonal in nature. While we will provide some more in depth analysis to these comments in regards to the data in tonight's Closer, as we have noted in the past, jobless claims have been roughly following standard historical seasonal patterns this year. July typically sees a temporary seasonal spike higher, but as we noted last week, that seasonal peak appears to have been put in place a bit later than usual which is rare but not exactly an unprecedented occurrence. While claims will likely get some seasonal tailwinds in the coming weeks (including this week of the year as claims have fallen around 90% of the time historically), the actual level of claims for the current week of the year is now well above comparable weeks for the few years prior to the pandemic. In other words, before or after seasonal adjustment, claims have come off their strongest levels and revisions have not exactly made things any better.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; As for continuing claims, the latest week saw a 25K decline to 1.359 million. While that does mark some deterioration from the strongest levels, unlike initial claims, continuing claims are still well below levels from prior to the pandemic indicating a still very healthy labor market the likes of which has not been seen in decades as the insured unemployment rate (continuing claims as a percentage of the number of those covered by state insurance programs) continues to hover near 1%.

&gt; # Most Countries Remain Below Pre-COVID Highs

&gt; As we do the last Wednesday of each month, today we published our latest update of the Global Macro Dashboard which provides an overview of the major economic data and financial markets of 22 major global economies. Taking a look at the US ETFs tracking these same countries shows a broad move higher in equities around the globe during the month of July. The US has led the way higher as the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) has rallied just over 5%. India (INDA), Sweden (EWD), and Singapore (EWS) have seen the next strongest moves with each one rallying 4% or more. That has brought US equities, India, and Singapore back above their 50-DMAs as well.

&gt; Given those moves are in the context of much larger pullbacks year to date, most country ETFs also currently remain below their pre-COVID highs (the 52-week high as of the S&amp;P 500 peak on 2/19/20). In fact, SPY, INDA, Taiwan (EWT), and Canada (EWC) are the only countries meaningfully above prior highs. Switzerland (EWL) is also technically a part of that list, but the one basis point difference is not much of a margin. At the moment, Brazil is down the most significantly from its pre-COVID high as it is still down 43%. However, unlike many other countries, the year-to-date decline has been very modest at only 1.76%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072722-GMD-1.png))**

&gt; Taking a look at the charts of the four countries that are handily above their pre-COVID highs, the trends of the past year are not exactly positive. Each one currently sits in a multi-month downtrend, and only India and the US have managed to break above their 50-DMAs. Even if those moving averages have been taken out, further progress by bulls would be required to eliminate those downtrends.

stocks," Monday, Jan. 08, 1973

BOOM is a word that forecasters hesitate to use because it suggests‚Äîbesides the delights of prosperity‚Äîa period of heated excess that sometimes leads to bust. But as they contemplate the prospects for the U.S. economy in 1973, the prophets are hard put to find any descriptive other than boom for what they foresee. The outlook is for a second straight year of strong growth in jobs, income, production, sales, profits‚Äîso much so that one of the prognosticators' problems is keeping their predictions optimistic enough. Lately they have had to add a few billion dollars to their output forecasts because 1972 ended with such a whoosh. In fact they have a nagging suspicion that the economy may be accelerating a shade too rapidly, raising some danger that the upsurge could turn into the kind of inflationary blow-off that precedes not exactly a bust but a slump. 

 These Government moves have produced a marked improvement in the public's psychology. As employment and incomes rose, people regained a sense of confidence. They reduced their savings from a startlingly high 8.2% of their income to some 7%, and started spending again. In turn, the bigger spending created more production and profits, which led to more hiring, more income‚Äîand still more spending. 

Most Wall Street analysts are convinced that the market will continue to climb smartly in 1973. Brokers looking for a marked increase in trading volume see signs that small investors are beginning to overcome fears instilled by the Wall Street slide of 1970 and return to the market. Investment from abroad is also on the rise. Economist Alan Greenspan estimates that foreigners put $1.6 billion into American securities last year and will buy $3 billion worth in 1973.

The biggest gainers are expected to be cyclical issues, the stocks that react most directly to swings in the economy. For example, the projected spending burst for capital improvements should burnish the allure of heavy equipment and machine-tool issues. Business inventory accumulation, which is just now beginning in earnest, should brighten prospects for copper, aluminum, steel, chemical and paper stocks. Among the categories expected to lag in 1973 are food stocks, which analysts believe are already fully valued, still-limping aerospace stocks and many speculative issues. For a broad range of stocks, however, 1973 is shaping up as a gilt-edged year.

AMD surpassed Intel‚Äôs market cap on Friday.

AMD stock rose over 3% for the day, giving the chipmaker a market capitalization of $153 billion. Intel fell nearly 9%, a day after disastrous earnings that missed expectations for profit and showed declining revenue. Intel‚Äôs market cap was $148 billion at the end of trading on Friday.

The shift is mostly symbolic but it signifies a much more competitive market for PC and server chips, where the two companies compete directly.

The milestone also suggests that investors may value an asset-light chipmaker over one that‚Äôs investing heavily in manufacturing. AMD outsources production to outside ‚Äúfabs,‚Äù or chip factories, whereas Intel has said it plans to continue building and operating plants.

In recent years, AMD chips have become much more competitive with Intel‚Äôs in terms of performance, even surpassing their speed and efficiency for some applications.

Intel said on Thursday that its disappointing report reflected execution issues and dropped its forecast for full-year earnings per share from $2.30 to $3.60. Intel also blamed a slowing PC market and macroeconomic conditions for its miss.

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger compared the company‚Äôs comeback strategy to climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in an interview with CNBC on Friday.

stocks,"The Federal Trade Commission is suing to block Facebook owner Meta from buying Within Unlimited, a company that makes the virtual reality fitness app Supernatural, the agency announced on Wednesday. The FTC alleges that Meta is ‚Äútrying to buy its way to the top‚Äù rather than compete on the merits in the VR-dedicated fitness app market, FTC Bureau of Competition Deputy Director John Newman said in a statement.

‚ÄúMeta already owns a best-selling virtual reality fitness app, and it had the capabilities to compete even more closely with Within‚Äôs popular Supernatural app,‚Äù Newman said. ‚ÄúBut Meta chose to buy market position instead of earning it on the merits. This is an illegal acquisition, and we will pursue all appropriate relief.‚Äù

A Meta spokesperson said in a statement the case ‚Äúis based on ideology and speculation, not evidence. The idea that this acquisition would lead to anticompetitive outcomes in a dynamic space with as much entry and growth as online and connected fitness is simply not credible.‚Äù

The company spokesperson added the agency‚Äôs lawsuit sends a ‚Äúchilling message to anyone who wishes to innovate in VR‚Äù and said Meta is ‚Äúconfident that our acquisition of Within will be good for people, developers, and the VR space.‚Äù

The lawsuit, which also names CEO and controlling shareholder Mark Zuckerberg as a defendant, echoes issues progressive critics have said the FTC should have raised in Facebook‚Äôs acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp roughly a decade earlier. The FTC is already separately suing Meta for illegal monopolization of the personal social networking market, in which the agency charges that Meta used those two acquisitions to shut down nascent competitors to increase its own dominance. Meta previously sought for that lawsuit to be dismissed, though it is still moving forward in a federal court after the judge allowed the FTC to revise its complaint.

When the monopolization case was first filed in 2020, Facebook‚Äôs chief counsel said the FTC was looking for a ‚Äúdo-over‚Äù of its original reviews of the Instagram and WhatsApp mergers, which happened years earlier. The FTC‚Äôs new lawsuit seeking to block the Within acquisition suggests the agency is trying to take bigger swings earlier on to prevent an even greater accumulation of power before a merger is allowed to close.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wag1ap/democrats_drafting_a_proposal_to_ban/)

(Bloomberg) --House Democrats are readying a proposal to restrict members of Congress, their staff and their families from trading securities.
A framework for legislation is set to be released next week by the Committee on House Administration, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked for anonymity because the plan hasn‚Äôt been made public.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have something very soon,‚Äù California Democrat Zoe Lofgren, the head of the committee, said Thursday, without giving any details.

Democrats have been working for months on some form of restrictions on stock trading by lawmakers, an issue that has united progressive Democrats and conservative Republicans. 

A separate effort to write legislation incorporating several proposals is underway in the Senate.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy both have indicated they would support restrictions on stock transactions. McCarthy said Thursday that he was aware a framework was being drafted, but said he hasn‚Äôt seen it and will wait until its release to say whether he would back the effort.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he also hasn‚Äôt seen the framework and doesn‚Äôt know when any legislation might be voted on.

Earlier: Congress Spins Wheels on Stock Trade Limits as Clock Ticks

One of the key points of contention has been whether to include family members in any ban on trading. Pelosi‚Äôs husband, Paul Pelosi, made his fortune in real estate and venture capital and frequently draws attention for his stock trades.

It‚Äôs also unclear if the legislation would address the judiciary. 

Multiple bills have been introduced in the House and Senate, ranging from outright bans on individual stock ownership to fuller disclosure of lawmaker finances. The efforts are directed at overhauling the current law, which bans members of Congress from using nonpublic information available to them for personal benefit and requires members, along with their spouses and dependent children, to disclose security transactions.",Democrats Drafting a Proposal to Ban Congressional Stock Trades,2022-07-30

The other day I stumbled on philips curve which implies that inflation and unemployment have an inverse relationship. Right now we have high inflation and low unemployment. 

Now the feds could only talk about how we are not in a recession right now even though we have had two negative gdp quarters in a row because of the low unemployment. At the same time they want to combat the high inflation.

From what I‚Äôve found, the rate hike effects won‚Äôt fully be felt for a year. Is the low unemployment rate we have now a lagging indicator from our 2 consecutive quarters of negative GDP and the rate hikes? Will unemployment rates rise only after the economic effects of high inflation and rate hikes are fully realized?

#[S&amp;P 500 futures gain after strong Apple, Amazon reports as index heads for best month since 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/28/stock-market-news-updates-open-to-close-future.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Friday as Wall Street looked to finish the week and the month higher.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 0.7%, while Nasdaq 100 futures added 1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 66 points, or 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was set to post strong weekly gains. The Dow is now up nearly 2% for the week, while the S&amp;P 500 the Nasdaq Composite are up 2.8%.
*****
&gt; The major averages were also on pace for their best month of 2022. The Dow is on track for a more than 5% gain for July, while the S&amp;P 500 could finish higher by 7.5%. The Nasdaq Composite, while still in bear market territory, is up more than 10% for the month.
*****
&gt; That performance is a stark contrast from the previous six months when stocks tumbled to their June bear market. The market reversed as investors fears about the aggressive pacing of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate increases started to wane and the idea that inflation has peaked began to settle in.
*****
&gt; Futures Thursday were supported by gains from two of the market‚Äôs biggest stocks. Amazon shares popped 12% after the e-commerce giant reported stronger-than-expected sales for the previous quarter, while Apple climbed 2.6% after posting better-than-expected iPhone revenue.
*****
&gt; Chevron and Exxon Mobil also posted better-than-expected results for the previous quarter, sending their shares higher.
*****
&gt; However, the latest batch of corporate results has been mixed.
*****
&gt; Shares of Roku sank more than 20% after the company missed estimates and warned of a slowdown in advertising. Chipmaker Intel dropped 7% after its quarterly results fell short of expectations.
*****
&gt; These moves come after a three-quarters of a percentage point hike from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and a negative GDP reading on Thursday.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe market is taking on a hope that slowing economic growth is going to result in a more dovish Fed moving forward, even if it‚Äôs a little further out. So it would make sense to me that weaker rates expectations moving forward would result in a little buoyancy in the equity markets,‚Äù said Lauren Goodwin, economist and portfolio strategist of New York Life Investments.
*****
&gt; However, Goodwin cautioned that the unusual economic environment and the long period before the next Fed meeting make it difficult to predict the central bank‚Äôs path from here.
*****
&gt; Investors will get updated looks at a key inflation reading and second-quarter employment costs on Friday, which could be key data points for the Fed as it considers its next move.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

stocks,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday that the U.S. economy was in transition, not recession, despite two consecutive quarters of negative growth. (Would it have to wait until Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008 to be called a recession?)

&amp;#x200B;

Yellen insisted the recession was a ""widespread weakening of our economy,"" including massive layoffs, business closures, strained household finances and a slowdown in private-sector activity.

&amp;#x200B;

""It's not what we're seeing now,"" she said at the Treasury Department's afternoon news conference. ""When you look at the economy, jobs are continuing to be created, household finances are still strong, consumers are spending and businesses are growing.""

&amp;#x200B;

However, the comments came on the same day that the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported a 0.9% drop in gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity, in the second quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

After contracting 1.6% in the first quarter, two consecutive declines met the commonly used definition of a recession. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research is the official arbiter of recessions and may not make a ruling for months.

&amp;#x200B;

Yellen began by listing the administration's economic achievements, including nonfarm payrolls that rose by more than 9 million (that's because of a rebound in employment after lockdowns during the pandemic, not from economic growth).

&amp;#x200B;

But inflation proved to be the bigger hurdle, rising to 9.1% in June while economic growth failed to keep up. Consumer and business confidence levels have plummeted, and recent surveys show that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe the country is in recession.

&amp;#x200B;

Yellen acknowledged the burden of higher prices and said the government was ""focused"" on addressing the issue.

&amp;#x200B;

""Our recovery has entered a new phase focused on delivering steady, steady growth without sacrificing earnings over the past 18 months,"" she said. ""We know we face challenges. Global growth is slowing. Inflation remains unacceptably high, and bringing it down is a priority for this administration.""

&amp;#x200B;

Presidents Joe Biden and Yellen have both touted the possibility of a new bill that Democratic lawmakers have apparently agreed to pass to fight inflation. The legislation aims to increase taxes, reduce drug costs and invest in renewable energy.

&amp;#x200B;

Yellen noted that while the Federal Reserve, which she chaired from 2014-18, ""plays a major role in reducing inflation, the president and I are committed to taking action to reduce costs and protect Americans from the global pressures we face.""

&amp;#x200B;

The Fed has raised rates four times this year, by a total of 2.25 percentage points, and is likely to raise rates further later in the year.

&amp;#x200B;

Yellen attributed the rise in inflation to the war in Ukraine, supply chain issues and the coronavirus pandemic. She did not discuss the impact of monetary and fiscal stimulus on price pressures.

(Don't be fooled: inflation was already high before the Ukraine war, and incompetent politicians shirk the blame. The White House has printed more money than ever in the past 3 years, which is the root cause of inflation.And the stock market has fallen a lot.)",Yellen said the economy is not in a recession and the stock market is not in a recession despite the decline in GDP (this is deception).,2022-07-29
stocks," The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by another 75 basis points despite acknowledging that economic growth is clearly slowing. The central bank, under Powell, reiterated that the path of least resistance is well-represented by the so-called dot plot:¬†More hikes ahead¬†‚Äî all the way to a fed funds rate of 3.75%!

And yet, the stock market has staged a¬†humongous rally,¬†led by the most valuation-sensitive and risk-sentiment-driven asset classes:¬†Nasdaq stocks **COMP,** **+1.08%** and crypto.

**So ‚Ä¶ what the heck?!**

It all boils down to how¬†one single sentence¬†was able to affect the¬†probability distributions¬†that investors were projecting for different asset classes.  
Does it sound complicated? Bear with me: it‚Äôs not!

**Why did stocks rally?**

When the FOMC‚Äôs press release was published, it looked like business as usual: A¬†well-telegraphed 75-bp¬†hike with the only small surprise represented by an unanimous vote despite clear acknowledgment that economic growth is softening.

But not even 15 minutes into the press conference, the¬†fireworks¬†went off!  
In particular, when Powell said: ‚Äò‚ÄòWe are now at levels broadly in line with our estimates of¬†neutral interest rates, and after front-loading our hiking cycle until now we will be much more¬†data-dependent¬†going forward.‚Äô‚Äô

 **This is very important for several reasons-**

The¬†neutral rate¬†is the prevailing rate at which the economy delivers its potential GDP growth rate ‚Äî without overheating or excessively cooling down. With this 75-bp hike, Powell told us the Fed just reached its estimate of a neutral rate and, hence, from here they aren‚Äôt contributing to economic overheating anymore. But that also means any further increases are going to put the Fed in an actively restrictive territory. And the bond market knows that every time the¬†Fed¬†became¬†restrictive¬†in the past, they ended up¬†breaking something.

Until Wednesday, you could be completely sure that the Fed would have just pressed on the accelerator ‚Äî inflation must come down; no space for nuance. So journalists asked questions to find out something about the ‚Äò‚Äònew‚Äô‚Äô forward guidance. It went roughly like this:

Journalist: ‚Äò‚ÄòMr. Powell, the bond market is pricing you to cut rates starting in early 2023 already. What are your comments?‚Äô‚Äô

Powell: ‚Äò‚ÄòHard to predict rates six months from now. We will be fully data-dependent.‚Äô‚Äô

Journalist: ‚Äò‚ÄòMr. Powell, due to the recent bond and equity market rally, financial conditions have eased quite a lot. What‚Äôs your take?‚Äô‚Äô

Powell: ‚Äò‚ÄòThe appropriate level of financial conditions will be reflected in the economy with a lag, and it‚Äôs hard to predict. We will be fully data dependent.‚Äô‚Äô 

He did it. He totally ditched forward guidance. And what happens when you do so? You give markets the green light to freely design their probability distributions across all asset classes without any anchor ‚Äî and that explains the gigantic risk rally ‚Äî as well as the jump in the broader S&amp;P 500 SPX, +1.21%.

**Let‚Äôs see why-**

If the Fed is so data-dependent, and there is basically one data they care about, it all boils down to how inflation will evolve in the near future ‚Äî and the bond market has a very strong opinion about that. Using CPI inflation swaps, I calculated the one-year forward, one-year inflation break-evens ‚Äî basically, the expected inflation between July 2023 and July 2024, which is represented in the chart above and sits at 2.9%. Remember that the Fed targets (core) PCE, which tends to historically be 30-40 bps below (core) CPI: Essentially, the bond market expects inflation to slow very aggressively and roughly hit the Fed‚Äôs target in the second half of 2023 already!

So if the Fed is not nearly on autopilot anymore, and markets have a strong opinion on inflation and growth collapsing, then they can also price all other asset classes around this base case scenario. It starts to be more clear now, right? This is what my Volatility Adjusted Market Dashboard (VAMD ‚Äî here‚Äôs a short explainer) showed soon after Powell enunciated that one single sentence.

* **Revenue**: $82.96 billion vs. $82.81 billion, according to Refinitiv

Investors will look to Apple‚Äôs fourth-quarter guidance for any signs of global consumer weakness around the world. Other vendors of PCs and smartphones have said during the quarter that sales are slowing, but mostly in the low-end market as opposed to the expensive price tiers Apple focuses on.

Analysts are expecting the company to give fourth-quarter guidance of $1.31 in earnings per share and nearly $90 billion in sales.

Apple hasn‚Äôt provided guidance since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, and has instead offered some data points that suggest where its revenue and earnings will land.

Apple investors will focus on the company‚Äôs business in China, which is not only a significant market for sales but also where most of its products are assembled.

Analysts polled by FactSet predict that Apple‚Äôs Greater China sales will be around $13.79 billion, which would represent a decline from the $14.56 billion in sales a year ago.

Apple warned in April that its revenue would be negatively affected by about $4 billion to $8 billion because of supply issues, including chip shortages. Several of Apple‚Äôs supply chain facilities had production shifted or canceled as part of China‚Äôs Covid restrictions during the quarter.

Investors will also want to keep an eye on Apple‚Äôs quickly growing and profitable services business, which includes monthly subscriptions, payment fees, warranties, search licensing fees from Google, and revenue from the iPhone App Store.

- mortgage application rates fell to near 40 year lows
- housing market is cooling extremely fast
- inflation is outpacing wages
- Americans have an all time high in CC debt
- sharply rising interest rates

[This image shows my quarterly results](https://imgur.com/a/xDMEEOk) since taking up active investing in earnest in 2020.

Consequently, this earmarked tax money, along with other funds related to this account, I pulled out (and deposited into my ""rainy day"" credit union account). As of this date, my TDA account is at $435k. It should also be noted, that I took big losses in BA, COIN, and NVDA (got back into NVDA though) during the last 6 months.

I currently have this $435k in 5 equities: MSFT (702 shrs); AMD (850 shrs); NVDA (400 shrs); KLAC (200 shrs); and AMAT (200 shrs). Only KLAC do I have a profit in (and earnings are today).

stocks,"For context let‚Äôs first review the basics. Real GDP is the inflation adjusted monetary value of all final goods and services produced, and sold, within a country during a quarter. It‚Äôs made up of four primary categories:

1. Consumer spending
2. Business spending
3. Government spending
4. Net Export 

Although it‚Äôs easy to react to a headline number, the devil is in the details for these large data dumps. Yes, it‚Äôs true that the advanced estimates for Real GDP were negative for the last two quarters, but the underlying data that resulted in those numbers has been anything but traditionally seen during the ‚Äúname brand‚Äù recessions. Typically negative GDP is marked by negative Consumer Spending (first category mentioned above). Notably, this category has stayed positive through both negative estimates of GDP this year. This fact, along with the data that shows aggregate consumer savings remain high, debt/disposable income ratios are near all time lows, and the labor market is strong, shows the consumer (the foundation of our economy) remains healthy. If this number were to be negative, then the recessionary light would start flashing yellow.

Now that we have addressed the first and most important category of GDP, let‚Äôs talk about the categories behind the negative readings. Namely, in Q1 it was Net Exports (fourth category mentioned above) and in Q2 it was Change in Private Inventory (a large part of the second category mentioned above). Without those being so dramatically negative, Real GDP would have been quite positive actually. We will ignore the third category, Government Spending, as that tends to be immaterial. 

So, let‚Äôs jump into this idea further, if Q1 Real GDP was negative because Net Exports were negative why is that not bad? Well, Net Exports is negative when we import more than we export. It‚Äôs a sign of strong demand (a good sign for the larger economy). We subtract the net number as these items are not officially produced in the U.S. and so we cannot account for them in our own production.

Next, Q2 Real GDP was negative because companies had to draw down their inventory to meet high/excess demand. When companies sell inventory that was produced during a previous quarter, during this quarter, we cannot attribute it to this quarter (see GDP definition above), and therefore must subtract it from Real GDP. Again, this imbalance resulted in overall Real GDP to be negative, but it really shows demand is strong. 

TLDR: GDP is not a monolith and the contributions of each category matters. Consumer spending is still growing and the negative headline numbers were caused by categories that actually reinforce this fact.",Why 2Q22‚Äôs Advanced GDP Estimate is Not a Recession Indicator,2022-07-29

* **House Democrats plan to unveil a ban on stock trading soon, Punchbowl News reported.**
* **The outlet said that a plan could come in August with votes in Congress in September.**
* **It comes after Insider found widespread violations of a law designed to prevent insider trading.**

 

House Democrats are close to introducing a ban on stock trading for members of Congress, their spouses, and senior staff members, [Punchbowl News reported](https://punchbowl.news/archive/7-28-22-punchbowl-news-am/), citing multiple unnamed sources.

The ban would make these lawmakers, spouses, and staffers choose between putting their assets in a blind trust ‚Äî giving up control to an independent third party ‚Äî or selling them altogether, Punchbowl reported.

The move came in the wake of Insider's ""[Conflicted Congress](https://www.businessinsider.com/financial-conflicts-congress-members-rated-2021-12)"" project, which showed widespread violation of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act.

The 2012 law was designed to combat insider trading by requiring timely disclosure of stock transactions, but is widely flouted.

Democrats plan to unveil their plan in early August, Punchbowl reported, with the potential for votes in Congress in September.

The plan would still let lawmakers hold mutual funds, per Punchbowl.

""We're almost ready to move forward on this,"" Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the chair of the House Administration Committee, told Punchbowl on Wednesday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been under pressure to introduce the ban. She¬†[initially said she opposed such a ban](https://www.businessinsider.com/we-are-free-market-economy-pelosi-rejects-stock-ban-congress-2021-12), but¬†[reversed her position](https://www.businessinsider.com/if-members-want-nancy-pelosi-reverses-on-stock-trade-ban-2022-1) earlier this year.

Some Republicans have shown support for curbing lawmakers' stock trades, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying he [would consider introducing](https://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-mccarthy-considers-barring-lawmakers-trading-stocks-2022-1) a ban if the GOP wins control of the House in the 2022 midterms. However, Republican lawmakers [appear to be split over the issue](https://www.businessinsider.com/republicans-congress-stock-trade-ban-kevin-mccarthy-2022-4).

Pelosi's husband, the venture capitalist Paul Pelosi, has also been under the spotlight recently. Insider found that since 2021, he's traded millions of dollars worth of stock and stock options involving 19 companies.

Pelosi says her husband has [never made stock trades](https://www.businessinsider.com/nancy-pelosi-stock-trading-husband-congress-2022-7) based on any information she's given him.

**Real gross domestic product** (GDP) decreased at an annual rate of 0.9 percent in the second quarter of 2022 (table 1), according to the ""advance"" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the first quarter, real GDP decreased 1.6 percent.

The GDP estimate released today is based on source data that are incomplete or subject to further revision by the source agency (refer to ""Source Data for the Advance Estimate"" on page 3). The ""second"" estimate for the second quarter, based on more complete data, will be released on August 25, 2022.

 

The decrease in **real GDP** reflected decreases in private inventory investment, residential fixed investment, federal government spending, state and local government spending, and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by increases in exports and personal consumption expenditures (PCE). Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased (table 2).

The decrease in private inventory investment was led by a decrease in retail trade (mainly general merchandise stores as well as motor vehicle dealers). The decrease in residential fixed investment was led by a decrease in ""other"" structures (specifically brokers' commissions). The decrease in federal government spending reflected a decrease in nondefense spending that was partly offset by an increase in defense spending. The decrease in nondefense spending reflected the sale of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which results in a corresponding decrease in consumption expenditures. ¬†Because the oil sold by the government enters private inventories, there is no direct net effect on GDP. The decrease in state and local government spending was led by a decrease in investment in structures. The decrease in nonresidential fixed investment reflected decreases in structures and equipment that were mostly offset by an increase in intellectual property products. The increase in imports reflected an increase in services (led by travel).

The increase in exports reflected increases in both goods (led by industrial supplies and materials) and services (led by travel). The increase in PCE reflected an increase in services (led by food services and accommodations as well as health care) that was partly offset by a decrease in goods (led by food and beverages).

Real GDP decreased less in the second quarter than in the first quarter, decreasing 0.9 percent after decreasing 1.6 percent. The smaller decrease reflected an upturn in exports and a smaller decrease in federal government spending that were partly offset by larger declines in private inventory investment and state and local government spending, a slowdown in PCE, and downturns in nonresidential fixed investment and residential fixed investment. Imports decelerated.

In the past, I mainly just sell any positions that are down near the end of the year that I also want to exit. I'm curious though if people are doing the other method of selling a down position and buying a similarly correlated position to maintain the same market exposure.

For example, selling SPY and then buying VTI to capture losses to offset gains, but it still maintains a very similar position.

**Powell will still go strong with future rate hikes, his words where not dovish, but some parts of the market seem to read a more dovish stance into it.**

Background: The current inflation is rooted in a multitude of factors, maybe more by the sheer number than in prior inflationary periods. 

The distortions caused by Covid19 such as homestay, QE, supply chain disruptions, overheating property market, procurement pattern shifts, labour and worker scarcity, stagnant or even decreasing investments in certain commodities (mining, development, exploration), shifted consumption patterns and further micro chain effects in various industry/business categories seem to last longer than anticipated - inflation is not transitionary.

Climate change and Russias war with Ukraine are additional disruption factors that make a recovery back to low inflation levels.

Because these inflation drivers have become more intrinsic the Fed won't have any other option than causing a recession. The longer this scenario takes, the more painful it will be.

stocks,"I am aware of the current hate on ARKK (and frankly lots of it is justified, don't get me wrong).

I bought $TDOC a few months ago after the news on the Goodwill Impairment loss from the Livongo acquisition. Figured it's one of the decent Telehealth plays and was already down 90% at the time. Also, the Goodwill Impairment loss is not relating to cash, and the acquisition of Livongo was made when $TDOC stock was pumped to the max anyways, so I wasn't very worried about that.

Recently, I've gotten into the habit of reading earnings reports of companies I own before checking the quote for the share price after hours, just so that I am not forced into conclusions by the market sentiment.

&amp;#x200B;

A few things I read for this earnings release:

‚Ä¢ Revenue up YoY at \~18%

‚Ä¢ Guidance for FY22 unchanged but potential to land on the lower end given market conditions. Not great but not terrible.

‚Ä¢ Goodwill Impairment is still shocking, but nothing particularly new for me there

‚Ä¢ Average revenue per member up \~13% YoY

‚Ä¢ Operating cash flow up almost 80% - I thought this was super bullish

‚Ä¢ Paid membership up 10%

Despite recent financial turmoil and a dismal housing market, there are key reasons why the economy will continue to expand, albeit at a modest pace, and not go into recession. Businesses are well poised to absorb a period of weaker product demand and are unlikely to significantly alter their hiring and investment behavior. Consumer spending is supported by rising incomes. Exports are strong. And monetary policy is consistent with sustained growth in domestic demand. Next year, we will look back and once again marvel at the flexibility and resilience of the economy.

To be sure, there is bad news. Housing construction and prices will continue to fall at least through 2008. There is an 18-year high in the inventory of unsold homes and soft sales that are constrained by several factors, including expectations that home prices have further to fall.

The surge in home ownership, which rose dramatically to nearly 70% in 2005 from 64% in 1994, has proved just as unsustainable as the reliance on subprime mortgages. That surge has begun to recede, and lower prices and onerous adjustable-rate mortgage resets point toward a modest further decline -- each one percentage point represents about one million homes. That decline, along with foreclosures, will elongate the housing inventory adjustment, exert downward pressure on prices, keep builders on the sidelines, and shrink employment in construction and the home finance sector.

 U.S. businesses are poised to withstand contraction.

During the late stages of prior economic expansions, as product demand slumped in response to excessive monetary restriction, firms tended to maintain production and employment growth, resulting in large inventory overhangs. Business capital spending also tended to grow too rapidly -- witness the late 1990s investment boom. Consequently, most of the decline in real GDP during prior recessions was attributable to inventory liquidation, which meant cutbacks in production and jobs, and sharp reductions in capital spending. Presently, those conditions don't exist.

Businesses in a wide range of industries outside of the housing sector have nimbly adjusted their production processes, and inventories are very lean. That significantly reduces the potential impact of any slowdown in demand on production and employment. Similarly, firms have constrained investment spending while maintaining high cash balances. Following the capital spending boom of the 1990s, the unwinding of the capital stock, net of depreciation, also lowers the probability of a jarring reduction in business investment spending.

 Fed monetary policy points toward sustained growth in nominal spending. Despite the financial turmoil, credit remains available to basic businesses and the vast majority of households, and a general ""credit crunch"" is highly unlikely to unfold.

Historically, real disposable personal income has been the dominant factor driving consumer spending. As long as businesses maintain employment, and wages continue to rise, reflecting tight labor markets, rising personal income will outweigh the negative impacts of declining home prices, declines in mortgage refinancing, and even the recent increase in energy prices, on consumption.

This assessment presumes that businesses will not cut net jobs. No doubt, jobs will be lost in some industries -- real estate, mortgage brokers and related finance, to name a few. But that's minor in the context of 138 million U.S. workers.

 My discussions with a wide array of business executives in an assortment of non-financial industries suggest that they have not materially altered their hiring plans, despite heightened concerns about general economic conditions. The majority plan to maintain employment levels or increase them in the next year, with most of the planned increases in export and international-related activities. September's reported rise in employment, covering the period of maximum financial crisis, is encouraging.

Once again, turmoil on Wall Street doesn't necessarily translate to contraction on Main Street.

Remember, following both the stock market crash of 1987 (which involved a cumulative 35% decline in equity valuations) and the 1998 financial crisis, the economy continued to expand. In both cases the Fed eased, financial markets absorbed the shock, and the economy proved resilient. The same will unfold this time; recession is not in the cards.

Rising rates tend to point to a strong economy. And that health usually means that borrowers have an easier time making loan payments and banks have fewer [non-performing assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-performing-assets.asp). It also means that banks can earn more from the spread between what they pay (to savers for [savings accounts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/savingsaccount.asp) and [certificates of deposit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp)) and what they can earn (from highly-rated debt like Treasuries).

Banks that might benefit as rates rise include Bank of America Corp. ([BAC](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=bac)), which has a substantial presence throughout the U.S.; JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ([JPM](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=jpm)), with its robust operations in the U.S. and worldwide; Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

([AFSIN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=afsin)), and The¬†Travelers Companies, Inc. ([TRV](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=trv)), don‚Äôt fare as well in low-rate climates because their underlying bond investments yield weak returns.

Insurers, which have steady cash flows, are compelled to hold lots of safe debt to back the insurance policies they write. In addition, the economic health dividend also applies to insurers. Improving [consumer sentiment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-sentiment.asp) means more car purchasing and improving home sales, which means more policy-writing.

## Beyond Financials

Financials aren‚Äôt the only star performers in a rising rate environment. [Consumer discretionary](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-discretionary.asp) stocks also can see a bump because improving employment, coupled with a healthier housing market, makes consumers more likely to splurge on purchases outside of the realm of [consumer staples](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerstaples.asp) (food, beverages, and hygiene goods).

Manufacturers and [sellers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seller.asp) of kitchen appliances, cars, clothes, hotels, restaurants, and movies also benefit from the economic health dividend. Companies to keep an eye on during interest rate increases include appliance maker Whirlpool Corp. and retailers Kohl's Corp., Costco Wholesale Corp., and Home Depot, Inc.¬†

Finally, the industrials sector also benefits from the economic health dividend indicated by rising rates. Companies like Ingersoll-Rand PLC¬†and manufacturers of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, tend to [outperform](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outperform.asp), as well as companies like PACCAR, a maker of heavy-duty trucks and truck parts.

stocks,"###Turns Out Hawkish Jay Might Be Transitory?


We‚Äôre all very aware of inflation.  Most people have felt it at least a little in their lives from gas prices, groceries, rent, staples, travel, and so on.  Some investors and traders expect inflation to be persistent and uncomfortably high for a while.  They might even be very bullish on the market in the medium-term but want to have at least some cash to ride out volatility as an emergency or hedge against potential large declines.

They may feel forced into a false dichotomy that either they have to see cash burn in real terms or speculate on the short-term direction of the market.  Turns out there are ways to potentially protect your cash if inflation ends up being more persistent than we all think.  One of those solutions is TIPS ‚Äì aka Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities.  Who are examples of people that might consider buying them?

* Someone looking to park cash to make a large purchase of some kind next year that can remain illiquid until that time but concerned that inflation will be very high.
* Someone bullish looking to hedge a highly growth tilted portfolio ‚Äì ‚Äúkeeping some dry powder‚Äù on the side.
* Older investors looking to protect the value of cash expecting interest rates to rise further.
* Bearish trader speculating on a market decline but not wanting to go all-in the high risk of shorting the market either directly or with options.

###How do they work?

TIPS are just like regular Treasury bonds.  They have a fixed coupon rate that is applied to its face value twice a year to pay interest.  The key difference however is that the face value or principal is continually updated to reflect changes in the CPI-U index (the general urban CPI index we are all familiar with on the news).

TIPS are issued and auctioned by the US Treasury in 5, 10, and 30 year terms.  Since their scheduled auction and maturity dates have effectively been [scattered throughout the year](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/221/Tentative-Auction-Schedule.pdf) you will always be able to find whatever term you are looking for, and they can be purchased from your broker.


###Accrued Principal

The adjusted principal or accrued principal is the most important part of a TIPS bond.  The way it is calculated is by multiplying the original face value by the **CPI Index Ratio** also called ‚Äúinflation factor‚Äù.  It is equal to the current CPI divided by the CPI index when the bond was issued.  Thus Index Ratio = (Reference CPI current date / Reference CPI issue date).

These index ratios can be verified and calculated just using [BLS data]( https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/) but the [Treasury also just publishes them for you.](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/tipscpi/tipscpi.htm)  Most brokers will include all this data on their client portal or trading UI.  

Here‚Äôs an example of a TIPS bond with the following ID, [CUSIP - 912828UH1]( https://i.imgur.com/PA5RVX9.png).  It has three key dates 1) Issue date 2) Dated date 3) Maturity date.  The issue and maturity is the same as a regular bond.  The ‚ÄúDated date‚Äù is the reference date to begin the CPI calculation, often middle of the month a couple weeks before the bond was auctioned, usually Jan 15th or Aug 15th.

For this bond, the dated date CPI is 230.82203 the CPI on January 15, 2013.  The CPI today is 291.88477 the ‚Äúdaily reference CPI‚Äù.  So the index ratio or inflation factor is 291.88477/230.82203 = 1.26454.  Hence the adjusted principal for each $1000 of face value is $1,264.54.

The adjusted principal is key because that moving balance is basically what coupon rates will be applied to on coupon dates and finally whatever it has climbed to is what you receive at maturity.  It is fairly straight-forward and intuitive but there is one small but very important detail to be aware of.  The CPI reference is lagging behind by three months.  

That means that the dated date (CPI at issue) is 1/15/2013 but in reality the CPI used is 10/15/2012.  Similarly the reference daily CPI today is actually 4/27/2022!  I am not sure what the reason for this is but if I had to guess it is because of data lags that used to exist and the time needed to publish CPI. In any case, this means that if you buy TIPS today they *do not yet include hot months of May, June, and anything that happened in July*!  Since CPI is published by month, a simple linear interpolation (straight average) is used to calculate CPI days between months.

###Effective Yield

Finally, the effective yield is what you would expect on an annualized basis assuming consumer prices were completely stable going forward.  It is determined the exact same way as a regular bond except the face value is the current daily accrued principal.  The Wall Street Journal has a nice table of all TIPS yields (if someone knows of a better table to compare yields please let me know).

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/tips

Today yields went down quite a bit based upon what was perceived as dovish Fed guidance which one would expect to be inflationary.  But if you look at the April 15 2024 TIPS, it has a yield of -.18% which is close to 0.  That means that most of the gain from this bond will be from inflation.  If somehow inflation were 0 from here you would basically break even.  

A regular Treasury bond with a maturity of 4/15/24 has a yield of 3.034%.  The difference between these two numbers can be used to calculate the **break-even rate**.  3.034-(-.18) = 3.214% is the *market‚Äôs expected annualized rate of inflation* for the next 21 months.

This is the critical number to look at when placing your bet.  If you think inflation will be higher than this figure you should buy TIPS.  If you think inflation will be lower you buy the normal Treasury instead.

###Final Thoughts

So there you have it, this is one tool to potentially hedge a bit against inflation.  Some might also like precious metals or BTC.  One strong advantage of TIPS is its stability and guaranteed nature of at least keeping up with inflation.  Pretty much nothing else can do this and basically the taxpayer foots the bill if inflation goes substantially higher than what regular Treasuries are pricing.

In a joint statement, the two Democrats said the legislation will be on the Senate floor next week. It includes roughly $370 billion in energy and climate spending, $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of subsidies for Affordable Care Act premiums, prescription drug reform and significant tax changes.

The agreement mirrors roughly what Manchin first laid out earlier this year, albeit with a more limited tax title. Democrats will raise revenues for the legislation by imposing a 15 percent corporate minimum tax, increasing IRS enforcement, reducing drug prices and closing the so-called carried interest loophole. Notably, the legislation also extends the Affordable Care Act subsidies through the 2024 election and the first term of Joe Biden‚Äôs presidency, taking a big political headache off the table for Democrats.

It does not include surtaxes on people making more than $10 million a year, ending the campaign of most Democrats to make the wealthy pay higher rates.

Another moderate Senate Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, learned of the deal on Wednesday afternoon and had no immediate comment.

Are earnings for this quarter behaving like a recessionary  environment?

So far, not seeing changes in the earning denominator sufficient to really increase P/E ratios dramatically.

GDP/inflation numbers are very aggregative metrics, so let's dive into what the actual companies are reporting.


**Big Banks**: 

- JPM expects credit losses to remain abnormally low through much of 2023, because customers haven‚Äôt yet drained cash balances that grew fatter during the pandemic, executives said Monday. ‚ÄúBig picture, the near-term credit outlook, especially for the U.S. consumer, remains strong,‚Äù said CFO Jeremy Barnum. 
- C: ""Little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-COVID levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress. And as any employer will tell you, the job market remains very tight.
- BAC: ""Our U.S. consumer clients remained resilient with continued strong deposit balances and spending levels,"" said CEO Brian Moynihan. Earlier this month, BofA said credit and debit card spending rose 11% in June.

**Restaurants/Food:**

- Chipotle/MCD report weakening demand from lower income consumers, but overall strong sales beats. In MCD, they see more substitution from fancier restaurants to MCD, and for Chipotle, they already cater to a slightly richer crowd.
- Major beat from KO

**Credit Card:** 

- Visa reporting strong consumer and lots of travel. ""Consumers are back on the road, visiting various corners of the world, resulting in cross-border travel volume surpassing 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began in early 2020,"" said Chairman and CEO Alfred F. Kelly, Jr."" 

**Auto:**

- GM wrote ""‚ÄúI would say that at the end of the day, all the data that we‚Äôve seen to date on vehicle pricing and demand remains strong‚Ä¶we still think that there is a big pocket of demand that hasn‚Äôt been met yet.""  Tuesday, General Motors GM +4.02% (GM) said it expects to make more money in the second half of the year. 
- F expects earnings to triple! 
- Mercedes: said it expects demand for its vehicles to outstrip supply for the rest of the year.

**Travel:**

- Hilton sees strong growth: The hotel industry has benefited from people spending on travel as well as hotel stays, though rising interest rates and tight financial conditions are stoking fears of a recession. However, credit card and other data indicate that travel demand is likely to remain robust.

**Software/tech:**

- MSFT with such strong guidance it brought the whole market up after its earnings. Azure grew 40% quarter over quarter, a very slight slowdown.
- SPOT sees major increase in subscribers. Spotify eclipsed forecasts and added 6mn subscribers to its service in the second quarter, defying the slowdown at Netflix that has weighed on the music company‚Äôs stock price. The company ended June with 188mn subscribers, beating its guidance for 187mn. Total users ‚Äî which includes those who do not pay ‚Äî also beat expectations, rising to 433mn.
- JPM on Google after earnings: ""Our primary takeaway is that search‚Äôs demand is persistent even in a tough macro advertising environment given its consistent and high ROI while benefiting from its diversification across online and offline as well as across verticals and geographies,‚Äù JMP analysts‚Äô noted.""

**Ecommerce:**

- Etsy with major beats. |The company also noted it acquired 6M new buyers during the quarter, shaking off concerns of post-pandemic deceleration.""
- AMZN prime day: ""The expanded inventory must have played a key role in enabling Amazon Prime Day 2022 to become the single biggest Prime Day event in its history, with members purchasing more than 300 million items worldwide. ""

**Logistics:**

- FedEx and UPS both beat and affirmed guidance

**Housing:**

- Definitely cooling here, but not all bad. ""The recent DHI results show that the post-pandemic overheated housing market is beginning to cool off. During the third quarter, the company recorded 16,693 new orders which were down 8% YoY. The net new orders slumped due to a meaningful rise in cancellations which rose to 24% as the rapid rise in mortgage rates created a minor panic among homebuyers. However, the good news is that management has mentioned in the Q3 earnings call that the reselling demand is quite good, and the cancellations are being resold smoothly.""

- Retail like WMT/TGT got crushed, but... with the totality of this data, suggests they had poor execution for inventories.
- QComm sees weaker smartphone demand, but on the other hand, AAPL sources say strong demand for its iPhone in China.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday moved to raise interest rates by 0.75% as the central bank attempts to avoid a deep recession.

The Fed has now moved in four consecutive meetings to increase borrowing costs in America, extending its effort to dampen household and business spending. The goal: to wrangle inflation running at rates unseen since the early 1980s.

Short-term borrowing rates are now between 2.25% and 2.50%, comparable to levels in 2019.",Fed raise rate by 75%. Cites softening demand but robust job market.,2022-07-28
stocks,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/fed-decision-july-2022-.html

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday enacted its second consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate increase as it seeks to tamp down runaway inflation without creating a recession.

In taking the benchmark overnight borrowing rate up to a range of 2.25%-2.5%, the moves in June and July represent the most stringent consecutive moves since the Fed began using the overnight funds rate as the principal tool of monetary policy in the early 1990s.

While the fed funds rate most directly impacts what banks charge each other for short-term loans, it feeds into a multitude of consumer products such as adjustable mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The increase takes the funds rate to its highest level since December 2018.

Markets largely expected the move after Fed officials telegraphed the increase in a series of statements since the June meeting. Central bankers have emphasized the importance of bringing down inflation even if it means slowing the economy.

In its post-meeting statement, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee cautioned that ‚Äúrecent indicators of spending and production have softened.‚Äù

‚ÄúNonetheless, job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low,‚Äù the committee added, using language similar to the June statement. Officials against described inflation as ‚Äúelevated‚Äù and ascribed the situation to supply chain issues and higher prices for food and energy along with ‚Äúbroader price pressures.‚Äú

The rate hike was approved unanimously. In June, Kansas City Fed President Esther George dissented, advocating a slower course with a half percentage point increase.

The increases come in a year that began with rates floating around zero but which has seen a commonly cited inflation measure run at 9.1% annually. The Fed aims for inflation around 2%, though it adjusted that goal in 2020 to allow it to run a bit hotter in the interest of full and inclusive employment.

In June, the unemployment rate held at 3.6%, close to full employment. But inflation, even by the Fed‚Äôs standard of core personal consumption expenditures, which was at 4.7% in May, is well off target.

The efforts to bring down inflation are not without risks.

The U.S. economy is teetering on a recession as inflation slows consumer purchases and dents business activity.

First-quarter GDP declined by 1.6% annualized, and markets were bracing for a reading on the second quarter to be released Thursday that could show consecutive declines, a widely used barometer for a recession. The Dow Jones estimate for Thursday‚Äôs reading is 0.3%.

Along with rate increases, the Fed is reducing the size of asset holdings on its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. Beginning, in June, the Fed began allowing some of the proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off.

The balance sheet has declined just $16 billion since the beginning of the roll-off, though the Fed set a cap of up to $47.5 billion that potentially could have been wound down. The cap will rise through the summer, eventually hitting $95 billion a month by September. The process is known in markets as ‚Äúquantitative tightening‚Äù and is another mechanism the Fed uses to impact financial conditions.

Along with the accelerated balance sheet runoff, markets expect the Fed to raise rates at least another half percentage point in September. Traders Wednesday afternoon were assigning about a 53% chance the central bank would go even further, with a third straight 0.75 percentage point, or 75 basis points, increase in September, according to CME Group data.

The FOMC does not meet in August, instead gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for its annual retreat.

Markets expect the Fed to start cutting rates by next summer, even though committee projections released in June show now cuts until at least 2024.

Multiple officials have said they expect to hike aggressively through September then assess what impact the moves were having on inflation. Despite the 1.5 percentage point increases between March and June, the June consumer price index reading was the highest since November 1981, with the rent index at its highest level since April 1986 and dental care costs hitting a record in a data series going back to 1995.

The central bank has faced critics, both for being too slow to tighten when inflation first started to accelerate in 2021, and for possibly going too far and causing a more severe economic downturn.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told CNBC on Wednesday that she worried the Fed hikes would pose economic danger to those at the lowest end of the economic spectrum by raising unemployment.",Fed hikes interest rates by 0.75 percentage point for second consecutive time to fight inflation,2022-07-28

Text:

An expected bill would give merchants power to choose different network when they receive many Visa and Mastercard credit cards
Two U.S. senators are preparing legislation that would give merchants power to process many Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. credit cards over different networks.

The bill, which could be introduced as soon as this week, aims to create more competition among U.S. credit-card networks, a sector where Visa and Mastercard have long dominated. Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, and Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, are expected to introduce the bill.

Mr. Marshall said banks and major card networks lobbied his office to not sign onto the bill. He decided to move forward after hearing from a growing number of merchants, including small businesses, restaurants, gas stations and convenience stores, about the toll of the rising credit-card fees set by Visa and Mastercard that are often pocketed by large banks.
Mr. Durbin spearheaded a similar rule for debit cards over a decade ago. The Durbin amendment, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, requires that merchants have the ability to choose from at least two unaffiliated debit-card networks when routing transactions.

Most shoppers don‚Äôt think twice about how their payments are processed when they buy something with a credit card. But the underlying plumbing and its associated fees represent a fierce source of contention between merchants that pay the fees and big card networks and banks that set or collect them. The expected bill reflects a growing scrutiny of the payments sector.

Once the bill is introduced, the Senate parliamentarian would decide which committee it goes through, according to people familiar with the matter. Because the bill would amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, it would likely be referred to the Senate Banking Committee, the people said. Neither Mr. Durbin nor Mr. Marshall is on the banking committee.

Rep. Peter Welch of Vermont plans to be the lead Democrat on a House bill, according to a person familiar with the matter. It couldn‚Äôt be determined if a House bill would have a Republican co-lead and if it would get introduced without one. 
Most U.S. banks that issue credit cards pair up with one of the two major networks, Visa or Mastercard. The network is typically listed on the front or back of the card. When a person uses a credit card at, say, a department store, the store has to pay card-related fees, including a so-called interchange fee to the card issuer and a network fee to Visa or Mastercard.
The networks set these fees and say they are important because they help cover costs for things like innovation and preventing fraud. Credit cards can also encourage consumers to buy more, networks say. 

Representatives for Visa, Mastercard and the Electronic Payments Coalition, which represents card issuers and networks, didn‚Äôt immediately have a comment. 

When a consumer pays with a credit card that has Visa or Mastercard listed on it, merchants generally have to route the payment through that network.
The bill would mandate that merchants in many cases have the right to route payments through an unaffiliated network. This would apply on Visa or Mastercard credit cards that are issued by banks with more than $100 billion in assets. 
The Merchants Payments Coalition, which represents merchant trade groups and lobbied for the bill, says merchants should have the choice to send credit-card payments over networks that set lower fees.
Visa and Mastercard handled roughly 77% of all general-purpose credit-card spending last year that occurred on cards issued in the U.S., according to the Nilson Report, a trade publication.","Senate Bill Takes Aim at Visa, Mastercard Credit-Card Fees",2022-07-28

 According to the SEC's complaint, after leaving Congress in 2011, Buyer formed a consulting firm, the Steve Buyer Group, which provided services to, among other clients, T-Mobile. In March 2018, Buyer attended a golf outing with a T-Mobile executive, from whom he learned about the company's then non-public plan to acquire Sprint. Buyer began purchasing Sprint securities the next day, and, ahead of the merger announcement, he acquired a total of $568,000 of Sprint common stock in his own personal accounts, a joint account with his cousin, and an acquaintance's account. After news of the merger leaked in April 2018, Buyer saw an immediate profit of more than $107,000.

In 2019, according to the SEC's complaint, Buyer purchased more than $1 million of Navigant Consulting, Inc. securities ahead of the public announcement that it would be acquired by another one of Buyer's consulting clients, Guidehouse LLP. Buyer again spread the purchases across several accounts, including his own accounts, joint accounts with his wife and son, his wife's personal account, and the same acquaintance's account involved in the Sprint trading. The complaint alleges that, in August 2019, on the day that the Navigant acquisition was publicly announced, Buyer sold nearly all of the shares he had acquired across the various accounts and profited more than $227,000.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Buyer with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, a permanent injunction, and an officer and director bar against Buyer. The complaint also seeks disgorgement from Buyer's wife, Joni Lynn Buyer, who profited when Buyer executed unlawful trades in her brokerage account. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced related criminal charges.

The SEC's investigation has been conducted by Carolyn Winters and Timothy Halloran with assistance from Jessica Regan. The investigation has been supervised by D. Mark Cave. The litigation will be led by Mr. Halloran under the supervision of Melissa Armstrong.

 Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also acknowledged the misdiagnosis coming from her own department, and that of current Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

""Both of us could have probably used a better word than 'transitory,'"" she told senators in June when asked about their remarks about inflation last year and their slow response to price pressures.

Top officials at the Federal Reserve were seeing inflation data come in very hot for months before policymakers moved to wind down monetary policies that were stimulating the economy.

 It's the Fed's task to tame inflation that is running at a pace not seen in four decades. To do so, it has been hiking interest rates at a fast pace.

Reining in inflation may take more aggressive monetary policy moves than the central bank has embraced in recent years, according to economists like Judd Cramer. His research indicates that the Fed may need to hike rates to levels not seen in decades to force rising prices into retreat.

""If inflation is going to be high and remain higher, that means that the neutral rate in the economy is also going to be higher because the price of goods are going up,"" he said to CNBC.

A June survey of inflation expectations from the New York Federal Reserve suggests the price hikes aren't over yet. The group predicts that by June 2023, prices will have risen approximately 6.8% from their current levels.

Maintaining stable prices and maximizing employment are the Fed's top responsibilities. Jobs appear plentiful in the U.S., which may give the central bank cover to raise interest rates at an aggressive pace through 2023.

I have literally 50% of the purchasing power I had just 2 years ago because inflation has eroded that purchasing power, and the Fed's rate hikes have crushed the market.

If the price of goods is climbing, the goods and services that companies are selling to me, then why the hell are their stock valuations dropping?  Why would I sell shares of profitable, growing, price-setting, companies for LESS than what I paid for their shares.

The way I see it, is my past earnings, the dollar, has been grossly devalued.  It's stolen away my purchasing power from my wages, but it's also stolen away purchasing power on past, stored earnings. I have no choice.  No matter what the Fed does, inducing a market downturn, inducing massive layoffs for a recession event.  I can't sell off my shares of companies that are still growing, still profitable, still have assets, and still defining the very prices on things, higher and higher, and higher.  The ONLY thing that is actually happening from my perspective, is that my entire lifetime of savings is getting stolen away.

What gives?  Why are stock valuations, retirement accounts going up instead of down?  Take for example that realty trust fund.  ALL they own is rent-seeking apartment units.  They sure as hell raised rent pricing.

stocks,"[Full Article](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/nancy-pelosis-husband-stirred-scrutiny-years-over-stock-purchases)

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi found herself in the center of a firestorm following one of her husband's most recent stock purchases, but his stock purchases have caught the media's attention and come under scrutiny for quite some time. 

Pelosi's latest headache ignited after her husband Paul, who owns a San Francisco investment and consulting firm, bought more than $1 million in Nvidia, a computer chip company, just weeks before a congressional vote that would provide massive subsidies to the industry.¬†

Pelosi said that¬†Paul has never made stock purchases¬†based on information she gave him when pressed by Fox News Digital on July 21. Her office also put the California Democrat at arm's length away from Paul's financial decisions.¬†

""The Speaker does not own any stocks,"" Drew Hammill, Pelosi's communications director, told FOX Business. ""The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions.""

But the headline-grabbing trade wasn't the first time Pelosi - who is among the wealthiest members of Congress - has garnered attention for her husband's stock timing.¬†

During summer 2021, Paul¬†cashed in on big tech¬†shortly before the House Judiciary Committee voted to curtail the ""unregulated power"" of companies like Google and Amazon, Fortune reported. The move, however, wasn't considered a threat to the companies, and the tech firms' stock prices continued to rise.

Paul, meanwhile, had purchased 4,000 shares of Alphabet, Google's parent company, by exercising call options a week before the vote. The call options - which give investors the right to buy shares of a company at a specific price - allowed him to snag the shares of Alphabet at $1,200 a piece as they closed that day at just over $2,500, according to Fortune. Paul earned $5.3 million on the investment at the time.

 A few months before the Alphabet purchase, Paul picked up¬†millions of dollars worth of Microsoft¬†stock just days before the company announced a lucrative government contract.¬†

Paul exercised call options and paid $1.95 million to buy 15,000 shares of Microsoft at a strike price of $130 on March 19, Fox Business reported. That same day, Paul paid $1.4 million for 10,000 shares valued at $140.

Microsoft announced a government contract worth nearly $22 billion to supply U.S. Army combat troops with augmented reality headsets just twelve days after Paul's purchase, and the company's share prices increased from about $230 to roughly $255 ‚Äì or close to 11% - in the weeks following the announcement.

And months before the Microsoft purchase, Paul snagged up between $500,000 and $1 million in Tesla investments in December 2020, or roughly a month before President Biden announced the federal government would transition its fleet to electric vehicles.¬†¬†

Biden, who was open about moving toward electric vehicles, in late January 2021, ""directed federal officials to devise a plan for converting all federal, state, local and tribal fleets, including 225,000 Postal Service vehicles, to ""clean and zero-emission vehicles,"" the Washington Post reported.¬†

Biden's infrastructure plan later set aside more than $170 billion for electric vehicle subsidies.¬†

""The Pelosi family's pattern of appearing to use her Speakership for their own personal financial benefit continues to raise red flags,"" Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of Americans for Public Trust, told FOX Business.¬†

""And Mr. Pelosi's latest stock purchase in a company set to receive a massive subsidy from Congress is no different,"" Sutherland added. ""It now seems they have thrown caution entirely to the wind, turning the Speaker's gavel into one giant golden parachute.""

Lawmakers' spouses can trade in companies or industries their partner may help regulate, but it's illegal for family members and members of Congress to profit from inside information.

 Congressional members, meanwhile, consistently beat the market, according to an Unusual Whales analysis from earlier this year.¬†¬†

The analysis found that lawmakers traded $290 million in stocks and other assets last year and, on average, outperformed the market, Reuters reported.¬†",Nancy Pelosi's husband has stirred scrutiny for years over his stock purchases,2022-07-27

&amp;nbsp;



Multiples have come down, the ukraine war has stagnated, I don't think china will continue with lockdowns, I don't think the dollar will keep rising and expectations have been massively lowered.

&amp;nbsp;

Russia has already massively reduced the gas to the eu. A likely bad result is Russia cutting off the gas completely but a lot of that has been priced in already imo and the eu countries are taking steps to protect themselves. I don't think we will see super widespread lockdowns in China. They are already trying to increase their vaccination rates and the cases have gone lower. But even with strict widespread  lockdowns we see companies like Tesla not get hit that hard because employees are lockdown in the plant and continue working. 

&amp;nbsp;

Dollar strength has hurt earnings some companies like google and microsoft have missed their earnings coz of that, some companies like Johnson and johnson have also seen their profits hit but have met earnings. I don't think we will see a ton more dollar strength because other central banks have started hiking along with the fed. And the market hasn't reacted very negatively to lower earnings coz of strong dollar.   
  
&amp;nbsp;

Expectations have been lowering for a few months. Micron had something like 24 earnings revisions and even though it's earnings weren't great it still went up coz it beat earnings and expectations. Same with Netflix, lost 1m subs and still went up. Recently walmart also came out and lowered expectations too. Big tech giants have announced hiring freezes and companies like coinbase and shopify are laying off ppl. Companies are scrambling to lower costs and prepare for the upcoming decline in revenue. Imo the bar for next earnings will be low and companies will do okay. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
  

Oil prices have gone down. There has been more time for supply chains to improve. The Fed will see 2 inflation reports by September. The market has priced in rate hike next year so if we get a surprise from the fed it will be most likely by next year if they decide to keep raising rates. And inflation started increasing late last year so the closer we get to years end we will be comparing now to a higher base which will mean lower inflation %

stocks,"Europe‚Äôs descent into an economic contraction looks to have been confirmed with Russia squeezing natural gas supplies to the bloc and heavy industry facing tough rationing in the coming months.

&amp;#x200B;

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move ‚Äî which will see flows to Germany fall to 20% of its capacity from an already low level of 40% ‚Äî was tantamount to a ‚Äúgas war‚Äù with Europe. Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said the excuse that maintenance was the reason for the supply cut was a ‚Äúfarce.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

It puts Europe in a tricky situation as it contends with rampant inflation, the war in Ukraine and an already troubled supply chain following the Covid-19 pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

Germany, the region's largest economy and traditional growth driver, has a particular reason to worry. It's largely reliant on Russian gas and is sliding toward a recession. The government is particularly worried about how it will keep the lights on over winter: Habeck said Monday evening that ‚Äúwe have a serious situation. It is time for everyone to understand that,‚Äù during an interview with broadcaster ARD.

&amp;#x200B;

He also said that Germany must reduce its gas consumption, noting ‚Äúwe‚Äôre working on that.‚Äù He said that in a scenario of low supplies, gas for industries will be reduced before private residences or critical infrastructure such as hospitals.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúOf course it‚Äôs a big concern, which I also share, that this can happen. Then certain production chains in Germany or Europe would simply no longer be manufactured. We have to avoid that with all the strength we have,‚Äù he said.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄêReliance on Russia„Äë

With Russia under a raft of international sanctions in response to its war on Ukraine, gas is one weapon it can use against Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúHigh energy costs are pushing Western Europe toward recession,‚Äù S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence said in a report Sunday.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúOur July forecast already incorporates mild second-quarter contractions in real GDP in the UK, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands. With inflation surprising on the upside, the central banks are stepping up the pace of monetary policy tightening. While a rebound in tourism and consumer services might give the region a slight lift in the summer quarter, another setback is likely in the fourth quarter given unreliable energy supplies,"" it added.

&amp;#x200B;

„Äê‚ÄòClear-cut‚Äô recession„Äë

Exceptionally high natural gas and electricity prices will damage industrial competitiveness in Germany and other manufacturing centers. S&amp;P warned the destructive Russia-Ukraine war will likely drag on through 2022, deflating consumer and business confidence across Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

It noted that euro zone real GDP growth is projected to slow from 5.4% in 2021 to 2.5% in 2022 and 1.2% in 2023, before improving to 2.0% in 2024.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúEU countries and the UK must do all they can to replenish gas stores before the cold kicks in ‚Äì this means looking at every way possible to reduce energy use and improve supply. We're already seeing a large increase in shipments of LNG from the Middle East and North America. But countries need to accelerate the modernisation of their own infrastructure. Mass deployment of low-carbon, domestic energy alternatives like mini nuclear reactors and community renewables is not just a 'nice to have', it's an imperative if we are to come out of this crisis stronger.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Putin knows what he's doing in the energy markets, says S&amp;P's Dan Yergin

With such a program of infrastructure modernization likely to take time, Europe is likely to feel more economic pain in the near term.

&amp;#x200B;

The possibility of a recession in Europe now seems ‚Äúclear-cut,‚Äù Citi economists and strategists said in a note Tuesday, with Russia‚Äôs decision to cut gas flows again likely to have ‚Äúthe consequence of pushing Europe into a deeper recession.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúAs plans for energy rationing for winter get agreed upon, we expect that tighter financial conditions in Europe will induce a much worse reaction in the real economy, given the stance in savings, household leverage and corporate balance sheets.

&amp;#x200B;

The recession in Europe may drag down the recovery of the entire world economy. The stock market tends to be an early indicator of economic conditions. Therefore, the global stock market may eventually enter a recession ahead of the crisis.",Europe will fall into recession early because of the war in Ukraine.

What I assume is going on going forward:

&gt;If no price seemed too high for stocks in the 1990s, in 2003 we‚Äôvereached the point at which no price appears to be low enough.

**Retail loves to buy at the high. And run at the lows.**

The words to take note:

&gt;And everyone who **buys a so-called ‚Äúhot‚Äù common-stock** issue, or makes a purchase in anyway similar thereto, **is either speculating or gambling**

Very meme stock like. And all those ETFs that bubbled in. And even the big known tech firms to be quite frank that keeps getting mentioned as 'safe'. Not saying any of them are un-investable. But one should be very careful when investing known stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

And all those questionable SPACs and IPOs:

&gt;In late 1967 the **IPO market heated up again;** in 1969 an astonishing 781 new stocks were born. That **oversupply** helped **create the bear markets** of 1969 and 1973‚Äì1974. In 1974 the IPO market was so dead that only nine new stocks were created all year; 1975 saw only 14 stocks born.That **undersupply, in turn, helped feed the bull market** of the 1980s, whenroughly 4,000 new stocks flooded the market‚Äîhelping to **trigger the enthusiasm** that led to the 1987 crash. Then the **cycle swung the other way again as IPOs dried up** in 1988‚Äì1990.  That shortage contributed to the bull market of the 1990s‚Äîand, right on cue, Wall Street got back into the business of creating new stocks, cranking out nearly 5,000 IPOs. Then, after thebubble burst in 2000, only 88 IPOs were issued in 2001

When all those SPACs were hitting the markets, those who read Intelligent Investor would have been very wary.

&gt;**Among the get-rich-quick toxins** that **poisoned** the mind of the investing public in the 1990s, one of the most lethal was the **idea** that can **build wealth by buying IPOs**.  
&gt;  
&gt;**From 1980 through 2001**, if you had bought the **average IPO** at its first public closing price and **held on for three years**, you would have **underperformed** the market by **more than 23 percentage points annually**

&amp;#x200B;

The idea that growth stocks (companies that lead the future innovation) should deliver superior results is not a supported one for much of history:

&gt;There is **no reason at all for thinking** that the average intelligentinvestor, even with much devoted effort, can **derive better results**over the years from the **purchase of growth stocks** than the investment companies specializing in this area.In the **two years** 1969 and 1970 the majority of the 126 ‚Äú**growth funds‚Äù did worse** than either index.  
&gt;  
&gt;The implication here is that **no outstanding rewards** came **from** diversified investment in **growth** companies as **compared** with that in **common stocks** **generally**

&amp;#x200B;

'Blue chips' (the 'safe stocks' everyone talks about). Are they actually safe if everyone is buying?:

&gt;In fact, **at** **least subconsciously**, they calculated that any price was toohigh for them because they were heading for extinction‚Äîjust as in1929 the companion theory for the ‚Äú**blue chips**‚Äù was that **no pricewas too high** for them because their future possibilities were limitless. Both of these views were exaggerations and were productive of serious investment errors.**Dow Jones Industrial Average had advanced only40%** from the end of 1938 to the 1946 high, Standard &amp; Poor‚Äôs indexof **low-priced stocks had shot up no less than 280% in the sameperiod.**

By going to 'safe stocks', the actual returns after a downturn were abysmal at some time periods. And in the case of Japanese market, going to the blue chips was the best way to lose money.

&amp;#x200B;

US tech is the future. There's no way it can ever not return 10% CAVG a year in S&amp;P 500.

&gt;It‚Äôs the end of 1989, and **you‚Äôre Japanese. Here are thefacts**:‚Ä¢ Over the **past 10 years**, your stock market has gained an annual**average of 21.2%,** well ahead of the 17.5% annual gains in theUnited States.‚Ä¢ **Japanese companies** are **buying up everything** in the UnitedStates from the Pebble Beach golf course to Rockefeller Center;meanwhile, **American firms** like Drexel Burnham Lambert, Financial Corp. of America, and Texaco are **going bankrupt**.‚Ä¢ The **U.S. high-tech industry is dying. Japan‚Äôs is booming.**  
&gt;  
&gt;In 1989, in the land of the rising sun, **you can only conclude** that**investing outside of Japan is the dumbest idea** since sushi vendingmachines. **Naturally, you put all your money in Japanese stocks**.The **result?** Over the next decade, you **lose roughly two-thirds ofyour money.**The **lesson?** It‚Äôs not that you should never invest in foreign marketslike Japan; **it‚Äôs that the Japanese should never have kept all theirmoney at home. And neither should you**

We all know what happened afterwards. Past performance is not indicative of future performance but the notion of the past decade of US tech reigning supreme in stock market should actually be warying for US investors. For much of it is not the profits that increased, but multiples instead (tldr: just paying higher $ per dollar instead of more $).

Diversification is the only free lunch. Please keep in mind you only have 1 retirement. If you are wrong and put all your money in 1 basket, there's no going back. Sheer greed for higher returns can ruin your plans in ways that are unplanned.

&amp;#x200B;

How to put price on a stock:

&gt;Graham feels that five elements are decisive.1 He summarizes them as:‚Ä¢ the company‚Äôs ‚Äú**general long-term prospects**‚Äù‚Ä¢ the **quality** of its management‚Ä¢ its **financial strength** and capital structure‚Ä¢ its **dividend record**‚Ä¢ and its current dividend rate**The long-term prospects.**

Refer to Security Analysis as you crunch up your own numbers. If you don't want to read that textbook, just standard DCA is basically what's needed using conservative assumptions and having some reasonable safety of margin (cause no one can reliably predict the future).

&amp;#x200B;

'Inflation is thing of past'. Deflation is an issue (and most likely is longer term).

&gt;In **recent years,** the true rate of **inflation** in the United States has probably runaround 1% annually‚Äîan **increase so infinitesimal** that many punditshave **proclaimed that ‚Äúinflation is dead.‚Äù**More basically still, the **intelligent investor must always be on guardagainst whatever is unexpected and underestimated**Since 1960, **69% of the world‚Äôs market-oriented countries havesuffered at least one year** in which inflation ran at an annualizedrate of 25% or more. On average, those inflationary periodsdestroyed 53% of an investor‚Äôs purchasing power. **We would becrazy not to hope that America is somehow exempt from such adisaster**. But we would be even crazier to conclude that it cannever happen here.

Inflation in 1973-1982 in US:

&gt;In 1979 alone, inflation raged at 13.3%, **paralyzing the economy in whatbecame known as ‚Äústagflation‚Äù**‚Äîand leading many commentatorsto question whether America could compete in the global market.Goods and services priced at $100 in the beginning of1973 cost $230 by the end of 1982, shriveling the value of a dollar to less than 45 cents. No one who lived through it would scoff at such **destruction of wealth; no one who is prudent can fail to protect against the risk that it might recur.**

'Inflation is good for stocks'. Maybe in the longer run but:

&gt;Our figures in Table 2-2 indicate that so far from **inflation havingbenefited** our corporations and their shareholders, its **effect hasbeen quite the opposite.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The **debt** of corporations has**expanded nearly fivefold** while their profits before taxes a littlemore than doubled. With the **great rise in interest rates** during thisperiod, it is evident that the **aggregate corporate debt** is now an  
&gt;  
&gt;**adverse economic factor** of some magnitude and a real problem formany individual enterprises.

And if stocks happen to go up because of inflation (remember 2020 March to last year?):

&gt;**if another bull market comes along**, he willtake the big rise not as a danger signal of an inevitable fall, not as achance to cash in on his handsome profits, but rather as a **vindication of the inflation hypothesis** and **as a reason to keep on buying**common stocks **no matter how high** the market level nor how lowthe dividend return. **That way lies sorrow**  
&gt;  
&gt;that **stocks failed to keep up with inflation about one-fifth of the time**

Would commodities necessarily shield you from stock market downturns?

&gt;The **near-complete failure of gold** to **protect** against a loss in thepurchasing power of the dollar must **cast grave doubt** on the ability of the ordinary investor to protect himself against inflation byputting his money in ‚Äúthings.‚Äù

Best to not think so.

As for conclusion to whether stocks will do well:

&gt;Common stocks may do better in the future than in the past, but they are farfrom certain to do so.

There is no guarantees in investing. There is no reason why stocks must do better than bonds. And that stocks must have positive returns (especially after inflation).

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, if anything is to follow, it is to buy profitable companies when there's nightmare in the markets. Historically, you would have been rewarded very well. This also shows up in Nick Sleep's letter in which Nick Sleep invests in a Zimbabwean firm despite the hyper inflation and government instability going on there. Hence, I put a portion of money on Alibaba, a Chinese tech stock.

&gt;And then **Mr. Market went into a sudden, nightmarish depression**.On September 30, 2002, just two and a half years after hitting$231.625 per share, Inktomi‚Äôs stock closed at 25 cents‚Äîcollapsingfrom a total market value of $25 billion to less than $40 million. HadInktomi‚Äôs **business dried up**? **Not at all**; over the previous 12 months,the company had generated $113 million in revenues. So what hadchanged? **Only Mr. Market‚Äôs mood**

I am not saying to touch Chinese stocks. Please don't. There's so much political risks and your money is your money. But at least for me, it seems the only reason people really hate Chinese profitable tech stocks is because the price went down. Anyways, ignore this commentary cause it can come off as a shilling.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, you might be wondering, if it were so 'obvious it was a bubble', did I get out of markets? And the answer is a resounding no.

Markets can stay irrational longer than one can stay solvent. I never sold my US/International index funds and don't plan to. Dot com bubble was first pointed out as a bubble in 1992. It wasn't until 2000 that it burst (8 years). If you stood in the sidelines for 8 years straight, you would never have gotten in the price of 1992.

Stay invested. But also don't fall for media. Just because media tells you to buy/sell love/hate a stock/sector, doesn't mean you should. Try to stay objective. And if possible, with serious retirement money, please don't speculate and invest in broad well diversified low turnover index funds for the long run.

stocks,"7.6% drop on WalMart today, off 10.04 for a gap of slightly under 10 points. Interestingly, this represents the second large down gap WMT has made since May. How long it will take to recover remains to be seen, but the point I‚Äôd like to bring up is that the bottom line of the news is that WMT is having to further discount prices because merchandise is not selling. 

If people are not shopping at their rollback mega-stores that dot the land, what does that say about American consumer confidence and the financial reserves of the typical WMT shopper? They‚Äôre apparently not shopping at AMZN, as they gapped down 5% today or Target, down 3.1%, also a gap.

Food banks across America are facing surging demands according to CNN. Is that a further indicator that the recession is already lapping at our heels? 

The CCI as reported today showed a drop in confidence of 2.7 points to 95.7. Still pretty high compared to a bit over 25% during the Great Recession, but by no means a positive economic number. Also, it‚Äôs the third consecutive drop in the CCI.

The silver lining? 

If inflationary pressures &gt; less shopping &gt; price cuts and price cuts = lower corporate profits, then the resulting reaction is deflationary pressure on the market. Oil, gas, lumber and housing prices are all dropping.

¬†If the Fed is less aggressive in tone tomorrow, they‚Äôll be looking at data like this and the CCI drop today rather than signaling the next hike.

So, if the market reacts favorably to the FOMC news, then I expect WMT to have a bounce through Friday. If the market‚Äôs down, then the chart tea leaves I read suggest 117.75-ish as the next support.

Finally, those tea leaves I was just reading? Well, they were apparently laced with peyote, so no one should take any of my views with any seriousness. This is NFA. Oohhhh, the monitor is melting . . .",WMT and FOMC thoughts,2022-07-27

I write ""failed"" because the drug was not a successful cancer treatment, but that does not mean the company will not figure out where they went wrong with this particular formula. Currently it's up over 40 percent from when I purchased it. The stock was sitting comfortably for years at much higher prices, for much longer periods. 

The analysts have changed their tone in a big way the last few months. It was a sell, then neutral, and now a buy/hold. Of course anything can happen, as we all know, but even if it hits its average 30 dollar range, you're looking at 2x-3x return at this point. 

I see stocks that have history and are legit companies, dropping tremendous percentages overnight, as huge opportunities. Obviously this is risky business, but I'm not day trading. Long term holding only. I wonder, almost everyday I see multiple stocks dropping over 40 percent. There are usually one or two 75 percent drops as well.

More details:

This is all in a Roth IRA that I've had since 2005. These are the current securities and funds in it, in order of % of portfolio from greatest to least based on current value. I'd like to get down to 20 or fewer, or as close to that as I can. Apple was nearly 50% of my portfolio and I've been slowing working it down to a smaller number. I'm happy with around 20% but may go as low as 10%.

I do a rebalancing twice a year usually at the beginning and again in the early fall, but this process has been ongoing for a few years after I wound up with so many stocks I realized I wasn't keeping close enough track of them to justify having so many individual securities.

For example I had MRVL and MU for many years and recently sold all the MRVL and put it in MU which has been a much stronger performer for me. I did the same with CTXS and CSCO. I don't want to just hold index funds, I do like having individual securities, growing positions in them and then selling a bit to make more (than usual) speculative investments after DRIP makes them outsized in my portfolio as I've done with Apple, Microsoft, and others. The especially speculative securities are pretty obvious (like PL, SIGA, BVNKF). Sometimes these are future tech, sometimes they're current even related. I usually don't hold them long unless they do great.

I like dividends, and I intentionally don't buy (or try to avoid as much as possible) anything related to fossil fuels, animal food production, military, jailing, police, or weapons of any kind.

stocks,"Hi folks, 

I just got this email back from Robinhood when I requested to  initiate the procedure to de-register my DRs and transfer the same to the an account with the Depository Trust Company (DT–°), as per the instructions provided by Gazprombank ([https://www.gazprombank.ru/docs/drcancellationeng/](https://www.gazprombank.ru/docs/drcancellationeng/)). I have about 100,000 USD invested in Sperbank and Gazprom, and don't want to get those liquidated, so am following those instructions to get this set up so I can continue holding on these stocks for the long term. 

I am not sure what I need to do for my next step though, even after the email. My goal is to transfer my ADRs into ordinary shares in a Russian brokerage account with Gazprombank.

I think I have until August 2nd before Robinhood automatically liquidates these stocks and takes them off the books, which would be a big loss for me. It sounds like they are not wanting to call the Depository Trust Company so I can then convert the DRs through BNY Mellon, and then open up a securities account Type C with Gazprombank.

What do you think are my next steps to make this happen according to the instructions from Gazprombank ([https://www.gazprombank.ru/docs/drcancellationeng/](https://www.gazprombank.ru/docs/drcancellationeng/))?

Texas Instruments Inc. shares rose in the extended session Tuesday after the chip maker reported a big earnings beat for the quarter and an outlook that was mostly above Wall Street estimates.

Texas Instruments [**TXN,** **-1.45%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/TXN?mod=MW_story_quote) shares rose 4% in after-hours trading, following a 1.5% decline in the regular session to close at $160.84.

For the second quarter, Texas Instruments posted net income of $2.29 billion, or $2.45 a share, compared with $1.93 billion, or $2.05 a share, in the year-ago period.

Revenue rose to $5.21 billion from $4.58 billion in the year-ago quarter, the company said.

Analysts had forecast earnings of $2.13 a share on revenue of $4.65 billion, based on the company‚Äôs outlook of $1.84 to $2.26 a share on revenue of $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion.

Sales of analog electronics, which convert real-world data such as sound or temperature into digital data, rose 15% to $3.99 billion from the year-ago period, while analysts had forecast $3.66 billion. Sales of embedded processors, which take that digital data and use it to perform specific tasks, rose 5% to $821 million, with analysts expecting $740 million.

For the third quarter, the company expects earnings of $2.23 to $2.51 a share on revenue of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion, while analysts surveyed by FactSet, on average, had forecast earnings of $2.26 a share on revenue of $4.98 billion.

Conversion feature. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock.

stocks,"Activision stock continues to trade at a steep discount to what MSFT has agreed to pay for the company, but an analyst at Moffett Nathanson thinks that could soon change.

Analyst Clay Griffin upgraded Activision (ticker: ATVI) stock to Outperform, maintaining a target of $95‚Äîthe amount per share MSFT intends to pay in its $69B deal for the videogame company. But including a gain of 0.5% to $79.65 on Monday, the shares remain 19% below that level.

‚ÄúThough we‚Äôd push back on the notion that Microsoft will be closing on Activision any day now, we do see strong rationale for why it ultimately should,‚Äù Griffin wrote. ‚ÄúWith still a \[nearly 20%\] discount to the deal price, Activision shares represent an uncorrelated market opportunity that, in our view, is worth an upgrade.‚Äù

Activision stock has traded well below the deal price since the transaction was announced in January, as investors worried that [t](https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-activision-merger-antitrust-51642526542?mod=article_inline)he Biden Admin might take it as an opportunity to rein in big tech. Microsoft has said it is confident the deal will close in the fiscal year ending June 2023.  

A combined Microsoft and Activision wouldn‚Äôt have a dominant stake in the $192.7 billion global games market. Microsoft has already said it plans to release Activision‚Äôs popular *Call of Duty* games on  (SONY) PlayStation consoles.

‚ÄúWe continue to believe that the deal *should* be approved,‚Äù Griffin wrote. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult for us to see how the transaction could inexorably alter the competitive landscape in the video game market.‚Äù

The analyst noted that the companies disclosed in March that they received a second request for information from the Federal Trade Commission. Microsoft declined to comment when asked if it has responded to the request. An Activision representative didn‚Äôt respond to an inquiry from *Barron‚Äôs*. historically, both companies complying with such a request would set a 30-day timer for the FTC to decide whether it wanted to sue to block the deal, though recent guidance warns it can still sue to challenge deals outside of that window if it determines a deal violates the law.

Griffin suggested that the radio silence since March suggests that there is ‚Äúprobably some back-and-forth and a good-faith effort on Microsoft/Activision‚Äôs part to address concerns the commission has.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one ever had the expectation that the FTC would give this deal a once-over and waive it in,‚Äù Griffin said. ‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt think the timing of resolution is necessarily imminent. But it‚Äôs not wrong to suggest that the Microsoft-Activision deal is entering its final stage.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Idea is to have a positive cash flows from the swap rates

Expected fed funds rate after 1 yr (July 2023) would be roughly 3% implied/assumed by the swap rates.

During the quarter, Microsoft reduced its quarterly guidance for income and revenue because of changing foreign-exchange rates. CEO Satya Nadella said employees will get pay increases, and the company introduced services to help customers deal with security incidents.

When management lowered earnings expectations, though, it didn‚Äôt factor in other issues that could hurt results.

Shares of Coinbase dropped more than 15% Tuesday on reports that it‚Äôs facing an SEC probe into whether the platform is offering unregistered securities.

Coinbase stock has lost more than 77% of its value this year.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is scrutinizing whether the company illegitimately let users trade digital assets that haven‚Äôt been registered as securities, CNBC has confirmed with a source. The news was earlier reported by Bloomberg.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to say it again and again: we are confident that our rigorous diligence process ‚Äî a process the SEC has already reviewed ‚Äî keeps securities off our platform,‚Äù said Coinbase‚Äôs chief legal officer Paul Grewal on Twitter. ‚ÄúWe look forward to engaging with the SEC on the matter.‚Äù

This SEC probe reportedly happened before and was separate from Coinbase‚Äôs alleged insider trading scheme that led to the fraud charges against an ex-Coinbase product manager and two other people Thursday. But SEC also filed a complaint the same day, claiming that nine of the 25 tokens allegedly traded in the scheme were securities.

The argument over how to classify cryptocurrency tokens is controversial. Generally speaking, if cryptocurrencies are commodities (like other kinds of currency), they would governed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But many crypto projects are funded by the sale of tokens whose primary value is speculative. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said that ‚Äúmany of these underlying tokens have the attributes of securities‚Äù and need to be regulated as such to protect investors.

In the agency‚Äôs recent lawsuit against the alleged insider trading scheme, the SEC wrote, ‚ÄúA digital token or crypto asset is a crypto asset security if it meets the definition of a security, which the Securities Act defines to include ‚Äòinvestment contract,‚Äô i.e., if it constitutes an investment of money, in a common enterprise, with a reasonable expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others.‚Äù

Other crypto firms, such as San Francisco-based Ripple, are also fighting lawsuits from SEC.

Most of the affected roles are in recruiting, support and sales, Lutke said in a memo posted on the company‚Äôs website. Shopify tumbled about 14% to $31.60 in premarket trading as of 9:19 a.m. New York time.¬†

‚ÄúWe bet that the channel mix -- the share of dollars that travel through e-commerce rather than physical retail -- would permanently leap ahead by five or even 10 years‚Äù because of the pandemic, Lutke wrote.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs now clear that bet didn‚Äôt pay off. What we see now is the mix reverting to roughly where pre-Covid data would have suggested it should be at this point.‚Äù¬†

About 1,000 workers will be affected, according to the Wall Street Journal, which was the first to report the memo.¬†

Shopify shares have fallen 73% this year as of Monday‚Äôs close, as online sellers face significant headwinds now that shoppers are returning to physical stores. The Ottawa-based company reported a huge profit miss in the first quarter and analysts have cut their expectations for the second quarter results, which are scheduled for tomorrow.¬†

stocks,"Technology stocks have been on a tear recently. Traders looking to catch the rally should look to the stocks that have just begun breaking out. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has gained almost 11% from its lowest close of the year in mid-June. That beats the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs roughly 8% gain since its mid-June low. Much of what is driving tech‚Äôs gains has been related to interest rates. Markets see a higher likelihood that inflation has peaked, and that the Federal Reserve will soon slow down the pace of interest-rate increases. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond has slipped since mid-June. Lower bond yields make future profits more valuable‚Äîand many fast-growing tech companies are valued on the basis that they‚Äôll churn out a chunk of their profits many years in the future. 

**Netflix (NFLX)** is a good example. The stock is up about 31% from its June low. At $218 a share, it‚Äôs now above its 50-day moving average of $187. That signifies that market participants are now willing to buy the stock at levels above a longer-term trend. That signals increased confidence in the stock‚Äôs outlook. It‚Äôs not just lower bond yields juicing the stock. Netflix‚Äôs earnings last week revealed fewer subscriber losses than analysts had anticipated, while management said it expects subscriber growth in the current quarter. Analysts are also predicting the company will rely less on upping its spending to accrue new subscribers and grow revenue, which will allow profit margins to expand. Earnings per share are expected to compound at annual rate of about 15% for the next three years, according to FactSet. 

**Spotify (SPOT)** is another example of a tech stock that is starting to break out. It has climbed about 20% from its 2022 low hit in mid-May. At $108, it‚Äôs above its 50-day moving average of about $105. Plus, buyers have frequently stepped in this year in the low-$90 area, to bring the stock upward. John Kolovos, chief technical strategist at Macro Risk Advisors, wrote that the stock could have easily hit a ‚Äúdouble bottom‚Äù in the low-$90 area. Spotify‚Äôs earnings are due out Wednesday. That will be a key catalyst keeping the stock trading at healthy levels, or it could send the price tumbling again. 

**Amazon.com** **(AMZN)** stock is also looking better. It has jumped about18% from its June bottom and, at $121, it is above its 50-day moving average of $113. A ‚Äúbullish breakout‚Äù is in play if the stock can continue upward, Kolovos wrote.  Earnings for the e-commerce giant are coming Thursday. This all may sound rosy, but there is plenty ahead that could complicate tech stocks‚Äô upward trajectory. Tuesday‚Äôs trading is evidence of that: The Nasdaq slid more than 1% after Walmart‚Äôs (WMT\_ earnings warning dented broader market sentiment. In addition, many tech companies report earnings in the next few weeks, and the Fed‚Äôs next interest-rate decision on Wednesday will be key for both the bond and stock markets. Meanwhile, all three of these tech stocks are still trading below their 200-day moving averages. In order for anyone to become even more bullish on these names, surpassing those levels will be key.

stocks,"We‚Äôre adopting a bullish view¬†toward the agricultural sector.¬†A number of factors lead us to believe that prices of agricultural commodities will rise materially over the coming years. These factors include:

‚óè the effects of monetary debasement as central banks fight to save economies from the effects of CoronaVirus shutdowns,

‚óè supply chain disruptions as a result of the CoronaV shutdowns

‚óè ridiculous government policies and interventions in the free market resulting in shortages

‚óè changing global weather patterns

There are¬†not a helluva lot of positive things one can say about being locked in for weeks on end. Aside from not having any Jehovah's witnesses knocking on my door, what it has done is allow for an even more substantial amount of research to be done. And I can assure you that‚Äôs coming off a high base. My wife complains that I do nothing else. Maybe.

I do think it‚Äôs been an eye-opening time for the average person who perhaps doesn‚Äôt spend too much time to be able to witness what happens when the government is put in charge of or at least has an even greater say in things like¬†the¬†distribution of goods and services. What you get is exactly what any student of history would be able to tell you, you‚Äôll get.

Shortages.

So far none of us are going hungry. However, there¬†is a¬†high probability that hunger will be in the headlines in a big way within the next 5 years.

Beneath still waters the devil is doing his thing Trouble is brewing and the western world can‚Äôt, or doesn‚Äôt want to see it. As I type¬†these crops cannot be harvested and sown,¬†and cattle herds are being cut in supply. What‚Äôs led to this development is unfortunately not likely to fade away and is going to have¬†long-term¬†economic and social implications that few are prepared for.

We want to NOT be in that camp.

### In a nutshell.

As you‚Äôre likely at this point intensely familiar with. Our analyses of the long-term political and social consequences of what we‚Äôre living through suggest that the current crisis is simply accelerating the trends that were underway. These trends in a nutshell are increasing geopolitical tensions combined with accelerating de-globalization, rapid increase in authoritarianism, and populism in western democracies. Independently, they are all inflationary. Together, they represent a potential veritable storm.

### Thanks to the¬†government's¬†reactions to the virus we can see more clearly the catalyst¬†for agriculture.

What you are probably not aware of is that we have been mulling over the agricultural sector for a couple of years now. We recognize that the sector has been out of¬†favor for more than a decade. It was and is at levels¬†that¬†make it the cheapest it‚Äôs been relative to indices such as the DOW or S&amp;P for decades. However, just because a sector is out of¬†favor¬†doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs a good investment unless there is a strong¬†fundamental proposition.

We read far, wide, and varied and kept hitting up against the same stumbling block - how can we possibly forecast the supply of grains coming out of Russia, Brazil, Australia, Europe, and North America? Forecasting production coming out of Australia (close to home) is challenging enough, especially with the floods, droughts,¬†etc. But what of the rest of the world? And Russia, China?

Moreover, it is the seasonality of¬†agriculture¬†that makes it challenging. Let‚Äôs say we could forecast what is projected to¬†happen next season with the production of wheat, corn, rice, etc. And let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs going to be a crappy¬†crop next year with prices rocketing. But what about next year¬†or a few more years out? Our investing style is to position for where markets will be 5+ yrs out - we don‚Äôt think we have¬†an¬†edge in forecasting where markets will be less than 2yrs out.

So time and time again we hit a wall. It is so frustrating because experience tells us that nasty¬†long-term¬†bear markets are followed by bull markets that surprise everyone to the upside. However, adding an objective fundamental narrative to this ""heuristic"" proved elusive... have we not looked hard enough, or is there something else from an upper macro level we're missing?

We suspect we were missing something of the higher macro order and that something wasn‚Äôt obvious from the popular narrative.

Then along¬†comes CoronaV..... and everything becomes so much clearer to us. In short,

The story is one of national food security (deglobalization) of food production and supply destruction.

stocks,"After the worst first half of the year for the S&amp;P500 since 1970, it is not surprising that the overall bearish sentiment is at very elevated levels right now. This is something that can be seen in various data points. For example, asset manager positioning in ALL equity futures (% OI) is currently at 2.08%. To put that into some context, this was 5.07% in March 2020, 3.11% in 2016 and 2.85% at the end of 2011, making the current matric a new record low over the past decade. There are also signs of capitulation in the broad equities market, with the percentage of companies trading below cash and short term investments reaching nearly 12%. Again, for some context, this number only briefly exceeded 10% at the bottoms in 2002 and 2008. Lastly, the corporate insider buy/sell ratio is indicating that insiders are once again on the buy side. On a historical basis, they have usually been on the right side of the trade. Does this all mean the bottom is in? No it does not, but in my view we are close to one when looking at these data points, especially if we see reversal in monetary policy by the FED soon.

Now I know some of you may be wondering what this has to do with the FED pivoting, as they have shown that they are not really bothered by the broad equities market correcting in the manner that it has done. After all, what they are concerned about is getting inflation down to more sustainable levels. Allow me to put a pin in that ‚Äòfight against inflation‚Äô for a moment and concentrate on something that monetary policy does care about, which is the economy. Let‚Äôs start off with everyone‚Äôs favorite subject, taxes. We are seeing tax receipts come in lower on the back of these rate hikes and an economy that is slamming the proverbial brakes. This was also covered by Bloomberg recently, who noted that June‚Äôs estimated payments, which are closely tied to capital-gains realizations, were 31% lower than the same period last year. With tax receipts going down and likely continuing the slide if we don‚Äôt see a turnaround in monetary policy, budget deficits are poised to go up and US entitlement spending is poised to consume approximately 90% of these US tax receipts, which is wholly unsustainable.

Another reason why the FED is on the cusp of either breaking the economy or breaking their rate hike policy, with my view being that the latter is far more likely, is that the treasury market is slowly breaking. With debt to GDP at around 130% in the US, a major rise in yields and the breaking of the treasury market is a sure fire way to put a bullet in the financial system, something that I believe is not on the cards. They can rectify this by pausing their rate hikes, cutting inflation loose to inflate debt to GDP down towards the high double digit level, start a new QE program to halt the cracks in the economy and implement yield curve control as the final piece of the pivot puzzle.

In my view, seeing the speed at which this is unfolding, I believe that we will see a pivot by the FED and the beginning of the aforementioned monetary policy roadmap before the end of Q3. What they would need to start this however, is something to justify it. Call it an excuse or rather a justification for changing said monetary policy. This would likely have to come in the form of lower inflation numbers, as that has been the most important driver vis a vis the current rate hiking cycle. I think that this is exactly what they are poised to receive very soon, so let‚Äôs take the pin out of this subject and address it. Why do I think that after we just had the highest inflation print in some years? Because inflation metrics that are looking ahead, such as 1-year inflation swaps and port data are pointing to slowing inflation and that will give the FED the excuse it needs to get back to said renewed QE. Various commodities are also down over the past few weeks and months, with two examples being copper (down from $4.82 to $3.41) and oil (down from $113.39 to $98.43). With inflation slowing down, QE is the most likely path going forward to support the economy, even if it means cutting the inflation loose and letting it go up for the coming 12-24 months to bring down debt to GDP as I mentioned earlier. Before that happens however, we are still looking at a strong US Dollar, as well as continued volatility and downside risk across the markets between now and the decision to stop hiking, which I again think will come before the end of this quarter.

What will benefit from this taking place? Asset classes across the board, with the broad equities market resuming an upward trajectory and commodities (such as copper) and energy (such as uranium and oil) performing exceptionally well as those embark on the second leg of their respective bull markets. One asset class that I want to touch upon briefly in particular, gold and silver, is poised to outperform in a QE and YCC environment after being in a correction for nearly 2 years now. Sentiment is scraping the bottom of the barrel for this asset class and from a TA point of view they are at historical support levels. There are various ways to play this, whether it be via an index tracking the actual metal, royalty companies or the miners themselves, but that is of course all dependent upon your own portfolio goals and risk tolerance.

I hope that this post has proven to be informative and the coming months will likely be as volatile as they will be eventful. Best of luck out there for all of you and I hope you have a good and healthy rest of your day people!",The case for a FED pivot and a big rally,2022-07-26

*****
&gt; A late Monday announcement from Walmart, which cut its quarterly and full-year profit estimates because of rising food inflation, alarmed investors who deliberated the implications for other retail stocks.

*****
&gt; Walmart plunged 9% in early morning trading and dragged other retailers with it. Target dropped 5.2%, and Amazon fell 3.7%. Kohl‚Äôs and Dollar General lost 4.5% and 3.6%, respectively, while Costco shed 3.1%.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúClearly, they have the wrong stuff, and they have to sell it more aggressively to clear that out, which looks like it‚Äôs going to take a pretty dramatic hit as a result of that,‚Äù Jeremy Bryan, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments, said during CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell: Overtime.‚Äù
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe question is, how does this relate to the rest of the discretionary space?‚Äù Bryan added.

*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Coca-Cola shares rose 1.3% premarket after the topped earnings and revenue expectations, citing recovering sales volume that dropped in the pandemic and higher pricing.
*****
&gt; Shares of McDonald‚Äôs eked traded just above the flat line in early trading following mixed second-quarter results, in which net sales were hurt in part by the closure of locations in Russia and Ukraine, but international growth elsewhere fueled a rise same-store sales.
*****
&gt; General Electric, UPS and 3M also reported strong quarterly earnings Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are bracing for an onslaught of mega-cap tech earnings and economic data this week, as well as the outcome of the Federal Reserve meeting, that will help Wall Street direct its expectations for the rest of the year.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think that there‚Äôs going to be a bifurcated market,‚Äù VantageRock Capital‚Äôs Avery Sheffield said during CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell: Overtime.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think the bottom might be in certain stocks, but nowhere in others. So this actually could be one of the most dynamic earnings seasons we‚Äôve seen in a long time.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Stocks traded in a narrow range during Monday‚Äôs session, with the S&amp;P 500 adding 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 90.75 points, or 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lagged, sliding 0.4%. All of the major averages are on track for their best month of the year.

Major U.S. and European banks should be prosecuted for ‚Äúcommitting war crimes‚Äù over their financing of trade with the Russian regime, according to a top aide to Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Oleg Ustenko, economic advisor to Zelenskyy, said the Ukrainian government believes banks, such as JPMorgan, HSBC and Citi, are aiding the Kremlin‚Äôs war efforts in Ukraine through financing companies that trade oil with Russia.  ‚ÄúEverybody who is financing these war criminals, who are doing these terrible things in Ukraine, are also committing war crimes in our logic,‚Äù he told CNBC‚Äôs Hadley Gamble Tuesday on ‚ÄúCapital Connection.‚Äù JPMorgan, HSBC and Citi did not immediately respond to CNBC‚Äôs request for comment on those allegations. Asked directly if he wants to see these banks prosecuted for war crimes, Ustenko said: ‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù

Ustenko said Zelenskyy believes these banks should be held accountable for prolonging the conflict and the war on Ukraine. His comments came in response to a FT report last week, which said that Ukraine‚Äôs government wrote to the chiefs of U.S. and European banks ‚Äî such as Jamie Dimon from JPMorgan and Noel Quinn from HSBC ‚Äî urging them to cut ties with the groups that are trading Russian oil. According to the FT, the letters accused Citigroup and Credit Agricole of ‚Äúprolonging‚Äù the war by providing finances to companies that ship Russian oil. The letters also reportedly warned the banks will not be allowed to take part in the reconstruction of Ukraine when the war is over.","Ukraine wants JPMorgan, Citi, HSBC prosecuted for war crimes",2022-07-26

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

stocks,"  As a result of Hungary's odious domestic and destructive foreign policy, the EU may abolish the right of an individual EU country to veto. At least, this is increasingly being discussed in Brussels and Berlin. Thus, German Chancellor O. Scholz is convinced that the right of veto, which allows one state to block the decision of the entire EU, should be abolished when it comes to EU foreign and security policy, as well as sanctions. O. Scholz acknowledged that the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine aggravated the issue of unity within the EU and has criticized Hungary for the ‚Äúselfish blockade‚Äù of joint decisions. ‚ÄúWe simply cannot afford to continue to maintain national vetoes, for example on foreign policy, if we want to be heard in a world where major geopolitical players compete,‚Äù the German chancellor emphasized in a column for the Frankfurter Allgemeine.

Other EU politicians are also discussing possible changes to the main agreement between EU members to exclude from it the principle of decision-making by consensus of all countries. The question of changing the main EU agreement was raised after the EU failed to approve the sixth package of sanctions against Russia for a long time because of Hungary's positions. As a result, the European Parliament called for the conference on the EU reforming. Now, when the war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine threatens to spread to the entire European continent, more and more EU countries support the idea of decision-making not by consensus (which gives individual countries to use the right of veto), but by a majority vote.

At the same time, the conflict between the EU and Hungary over the attitude towards the Russian neo-empire did not arise today, but already quite a long time ago. Prime Minister V. Orban, who has been in power for 18 years (with a break), consistently implements an ultranationalist policy. Thanks to him, Hungary is known to everyone as a ‚Äúmafia state‚Äù with total corruption, completely controlled media, a well-established propaganda machine and informal militaristic organizations. The country is dominated by Hungarian chauvinism, anti-Semitism, persecution of Roma/Gypsies, harsh anti-immigrant sentiment, hatred of people of color, and total rejection of the LGBTQ community members.

Not so long ago, Hungary threatened to block the EU budget process by applying a veto on the budget of 2021-2027, and the economy restoration fund after a pandemic (it was about a package of ‚Ç¨ 1.8 trillion), due to the fact that the main EU financial document contained a new item about the establishment of direct dependence between the access of countries to the EU money and adherence to the rule of law within these countries. Brussels (and then, and now) has raised an official claims to Hungary, due to a violation of the principles of independence of courts, mass media and non-governmental organizations, as well as the general erosion of democracy.

Thus, the history of differences between the liberal Europe and Hungary, building an authoritarian society, lasts long, and the war of Putin Russia against democratic Ukraine only exacerbated this issue.

stocks,"Just five companies control nearly a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 index‚Äôs market cap, and they will all report earnings this week that could determine the direction of the market for weeks or months to come.

As Big Tech ‚Äî Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.36% GOOG, -0.14%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.05%, Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.74%, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META, -1.55% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.59% ‚Äî prepares to report, there are serious doubts about their near future for the first time. All five have signaled that they are cutting costs or plan to soon, as MarketWatch‚Äôs Jon Swartz reported.

Amazon ripped off the Band-Aid three months ago, and it looks like some of its Big Tech cohorts may look to do the same in this earnings season. Apple has reportedly planned cost cuts for next year, while Microsoft is closing down open positions and making small layoffs. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees on the last day of the second quarter that they face one of the ‚Äúworst downturns that we‚Äôve seen in recent history,‚Äù and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai warned employees of slowing hiring just a few days after the quarter close. Results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.10% and Twitter Inc. TWTR, -1.51% show concerns about the digital-advertising business are founded. Even an early warning from Microsoft about its earnings and the knowledge that Amazon is already cutting costs may not be enough to truly prepare Wall Street for what may be coming. One area that could cause a major ripple is a slowdown in cloud-computing growth, as Therese Poletti opined, with one analyst telling her that ‚Äúpeople are going to freak out.‚Äù

Any big moves for those five companies would have major ripple effects in the market. Collectively worth roughly $7.5 trillion despite the declines that have already struck this year, the five companies make up about 23% of the total market cap of the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, +0.13%, according to the Dow Jones Market Data Group. The group‚Äôs earnings and revenue have buffeted the entire market in recent years, as the COVID-19 pandemic juiced their balance sheets. Collectively, the quintet produced profit surpassing $320 billion last year, with sales topping $1.4 trillion, which would rank 13th in gross domestic product as a nation, just behind Brazil and ahead of Australia, according to World Bank figures.

This year is going to be a tough comparison to that performance, especially after Amazon reported a loss of nearly $4 billion in the first quarter. And cost-cutting from those companies will have an effect on the larger tech economy. The true concern in Silicon Valley and Wall Street is that a domino effect happens ‚Äî Big Tech cuts costs, hurting smaller tech companies that rely on them, who in turn go under or at least cut back on costs such as cloud computing, cloud software, hardware and more, causing more pain throughout the industry.

stocks,"Alibaba‚Äôs Hong Kong-listed stock jumped 6% on Tuesday after the Chinese tech giant said it will apply for a dual primary listing in Hong Kong.

&amp;#x200B;

The tech giant‚Äôs shares are already traded on both U.S. and Hong Kong exchanges, but the current listing in Hong Kong is a secondary one.

&amp;#x200B;

The primary listing process in Hong Kong is expected to be completed before the end of 2022, the company said in a press release.

&amp;#x200B;

The Hong Kong Exchange recently changed rules, making it easier for more companies to get dual primary listings in the Chinese financial hub. Alibaba is reportedly the first large company to take advantage of this rule change, according to Reuters.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúWe have received approval from the Board to apply to add Hong Kong as another primary listing venue, in the hopes of fostering a wider and more diversified investor base to share in Alibaba‚Äôs growth and future, especially from China and other markets in Asia,‚Äù Alibaba Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said, according to the media release.

&amp;#x200B;

Alibaba‚Äôs stock was last up 6.02%.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄòStrategic‚Äô move

The move is ‚Äúvery strategic‚Äù because the Hong Kong market has not offered as much liquidity to Alibaba as the U.S. market, said Ronald Wan, non-executive chairman of Partners Fintech Holdings.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúWe need something else, we need Stock Connect to bring in mainland investors to invest in the stocks,‚Äù he told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúStreet Signs Asia‚Äù on Tuesday.

&amp;#x200B;

Having a primary listing in Hong Kong will allow Alibaba to be included in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, which gives investors in mainland China access to the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

Chinese electric vehicle makers Xpeng and Li Auto have dual primary listings in Hong Kong and the U.S., and have both been included in the stock connect scheme.

&amp;#x200B;

A China Renaissance report from January noted that, based on historical data, the turnover and velocity of companies with a secondary listing in Hong Kong are much lower than that for ADRs in the U.S.

stocks,"I roped together 5 of the most ""interesting/important"" things about KULR that I could find.... I would love it if you guys could skim through this and give me your thoughts!  


1. KULR announced securing a battery safety contract with NASA to test its lithium-ion cells for future battery packs designed for the Artemis Program, a series of US-led international human spaceflight programs. In that deal, KULR will be processing up to 10,000 lithium-ion cells per week and preparing for tests performed by NASA, the Department of Defense, and others completing crewed flighted missions.  

2. KULR added an additional and potentially substantial revenue-generating shot on goal to its mix after releasing a passive propagation resistant (""PPR"") solution in its KULR-Tech Safe Case product family for maritime lithium-ion battery safety. This can be a big deal, noting that it's the only known PPR solution meeting the upcoming United States Coast Guard's new safety requirements for the passenger vessel industry.  

3. KULR has signed multi-million dollar contracts and is advancing development deals with industry behemoths, including NASA, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT, $LMT), Johnson Controls, Leidos (NYSE: LDOS), and the Andretti United E Team racing group. Few, if any, other micro-cap names can come close to boasting a similar list  

4. KULR's recent acquisition of Centropy AB's innovative technologies also adds considerable value, both intrinsically and inherently. The thermal management technologies acquired through this deal can be seamlessly integrated into their existing portfolio of technologies and services for meeting demand in industries like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cryptocurrency mining ‚Äì each presenting significant new market opportunities.  

5. KULR has partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) to assist in their lithium-ion battery lifecycle initiative alongside Clarios. This initiative seeks to improve lithium-ion battery production, recycling, and disposal practices. With involvement in initiatives like this coming straight from the DoE, KULR is cementing itself as the go-to company for industry-specific battery safety and disposal services. And with billions of lithium-ion batteries being used, that position is enviable. [https://chartingdaily.com/revolutionary--battery-tech](https://chartingdaily.com/revolutionary--battery-tech)

stocks,"I'm in my early 20s and in a situation where my parents are willing and able to support me for many years into the future, and I'm wondering if becoming a day trader is a viable career to pursue, or if I should go back to school instead. I would be willing and able to dedicate six to eight hours per day studying and practicing day trading, in hopes of eventually becoming profitable. The goal would be to make enough year after year to live comfortably on my own and afford any expenses. 

I know the odds of being profitable long term from day trading are low, but I'm pretty sure the odds are a lot better then a purely creative pursuit like being an author, which would be my dream occupation. Same when you compare it to something like being an actor or singer. The chances of those are likely less then one percent whereas it seems the chances of being a successful day trader are more like five to ten percent if you're willing to fully dedicate yourself to it. If I can prove that I'm profitable long term I have access to at least $100,000 to trade with and as far as I'm aware there aren't any account minimums in Canada.  

Writing is something I could do for a few hours every evening and probably still make a go at it, but from the research I've done day trading works a lot better if you're fully committed. If I don't go the trading route then my plan is to go back to school for something IT related as I enjoy tech and problem solving. I would still much rather be a day trader though as I can set my own hours, not have a boss, and learn at my own pace. With everything said how viable is a career as a day trader and is it something I should try and pursue?   

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR - I have the ability to dedicate myself fulltime to learning day trading I'm wondering if it's a viable career. The goal would be to become profitable long term, and consistently make enough to live comfortably on my own. If I can prove that I'm profitable I can access at least $100,000 to trade with. Even though the odds are low they seem a lot better then a purely creative pursuit like writing, acting, or singing. Day trading is something that works a lot better to focus on completely if you want any chance of making it work. I don't think I would be able to go to school fulltime for a challenging degree and try to succeed at day trading as well.",Can Day Trading Be A Viable Career?,2022-07-26

Link: [https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html)

This tool is a great way to determine how big of a rate hike the market has priced in already.  Obviously it's not a PERFECT indicator, but it's still very helpful.  

You can see the current target rate is 150 - 175 bps and this tool shows that there's a 77.5% the new target rate will be 225 - 250 bps (implies a 75 bp rate hike...really spelling this out for you guys lol). So if we end up getting a surprise 100 bp hike, I would imagine the market will respond poorly.  You can also click through to see what the market has priced in during previous weeks/months (check out the Compare tab).  It's a pretty neat tool.

Of course the rate hike isn't the ONLY important thing we'll hear.  The verbiage used in the FOMC statement (specifically any changes to the statement compared to prior month) could also have big implications.  And Jay Powell also does a press conference and in the past we've seen his answers to questions in that press conference dramatically impact the market...although I imagine he tries to avoid causing any ripples in the market during those meetings.",All stock investors should be aware of this Fed rate hike predictor tool,2022-07-26

stocks,"&gt; The typical cup of coffee served in a 17th-century London coffee house was described as tasting of ‚Äúsyrup of soot‚Äù. It was thick, smoky and strong. Today the preference is for sweeter drinks. Bulletproof coffee made with liquid butter, say. Or syrupy lattes and cold brew coffee, steeped in room-temperature water for hours.

[Source](https://www.ft.com/content/f8adee1a-9535-4f7c-b21f-6186b55e01de).

Others used the phrase ""essence of old shoes."" Yet despite this, coffeeshops were even more commonplace back in the 1700s than today's London: 

&gt; There are about 600 coffee drive-throughs. Do not expect the expansion to stop. By 1739 there were more than 550 coffee houses in London, according to Jonathan Morris, professor of history at the University of Hertfordshire. That equals about one per thousand residents. Today, London is estimated to have more than 3,000 caf√©s ‚Äî about one per 2,000 residents. Coffee chains may feel ubiquitous but history suggests there is room for more. 

In a substantially poorer London with much fewer options, there were twice as many coffeeshops per person as there are today. They were certainly a gathering-place for the elite bankers, but clearly coffeeshops appealed to a broader class of people to be so commonplace.

The trend is moving back to its historical roots:

&gt; Regardless, demand for coffee is still rising. Pubs still outnumber coffee shops in the UK. But while pubs are disappearing from high streets, more caf√©s are appearing each year. In the UK, the number of coffee shops doubled between 2009 and 2019 to almost 26,000, according to Allegra World Coffee Portal. 

Today's shops offer WiFi, heating/AC, public bathrooms (well, maybe not SBUX soon), drive-thru options, mobile pre-ordering, 21st century disposable income, snacks, dozens of twisted flavors, and even pre-loaded coffee 'bank accounts.' Over [1.4 billion dollars](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/starbucks-devised-a-brilliant-plan-to-borrow-money-from-customers-without-getting-anybody-angry.html) rested as ""Starbucks customer prepaid balance"" in October of 2020.

That said, expansion of SBUX in UK is at risk, with them looking to sell off their holdings. Regardless, the history of London shows that coffee shops is here to stay, no matter the worries about unionization, inflation eating away at income, or worries about crime.","Coffeeshops are centuries old phenomenon, and history shows there is great room for expansion.",2022-07-26

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;SEC. JANET YELLEN: I do want to emphasize: What a recession really means is a broad-based contraction in the economy. And even if that \[second-quarter-GDP-growth\] number is negative, we are not in a recession now. And I would, you know, warn that we should be not characterizing that as a recession ‚Äî  
&gt;  
&gt;  
CHUCK TODD: I understand that, but you‚Äôre splitting hairs. I mean, if the technical definition is two quarters of contraction, you‚Äôre saying that‚Äôs not a recession?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;YELLEN: That‚Äôs not the tech ‚Äî  
  
&gt;  
&gt;TODD: No?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;YELLEN: That‚Äôs not the technical definition. There‚Äôs an organization called the National Bureau of Economic Research that looks at a broad range of data in deciding whether or not there is a recession. And most of the data that they look at right now continues to be strong. I would be amazed if the NBER would declare this period to be a recession, even if it happens to have two quarters of negative growth. We‚Äôve got a very strong labor market. When you‚Äôre creating almost 400,000 jobs a month, that is not a recession.

&amp;#x200B;

The National Bureau of Economic Research isn‚Äôt exactly speedy about these declarations. Back in December 2008, [it announced that the U.S. was in a recession . . . that had begun almost one year earlier in January 2008](https://www.nber.org/news/business-cycle-dating-committee-announcement-december-1-2008).

The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed insider trading charges against Stephen Buyer, a former U.S. Representative for Indiana's 4th Congressional District.

According to the SEC‚Äôs complaint, after leaving Congress in 2011, Buyer formed a consulting firm, the Steve Buyer Group, which provided services to, among other clients, T-Mobile. In March 2018, Buyer attended a golf outing with a T-Mobile executive, from whom he learned about the company‚Äôs then nonpublic plan to acquire Sprint. Buyer began purchasing Sprint securities the next day, and, ahead of the merger announcement, he acquired a total of $568,000 of Sprint common stock in his own personal accounts, a joint account with his cousin, and an acquaintance‚Äôs account. After news of the merger leaked in April 2018, Buyer saw an immediate profit of more than $107,000.

In 2019, according to the SEC‚Äôs complaint, Buyer purchased more than $1 million of Navigant Consulting, Inc. securities ahead of the public announcement that it would be acquired by another one of Buyer‚Äôs consulting clients, Guidehouse LLP. Buyer again spread the purchases across several accounts, including his own accounts, joint accounts with his wife and son, his wife‚Äôs personal account, and the same acquaintance‚Äôs account involved in the Sprint trading. The complaint alleges that, in August 2019, on the day that the Navigant acquisition was publicly announced, Buyer sold nearly all of the shares he had acquired across the various accounts and profited more than $227,000.

""When insiders like Buyer ‚Äì an attorney, a former prosecutor, and a retired Congressman ‚Äì monetize their access to material, nonpublic information, as alleged in this case, they not only violate the federal securities laws, but also undermine public trust and confidence in the fairness of our markets,"" said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division. ""We are committed to doing all we can to maintain and enhance public trust by leveling the playing field and holding Buyer accountable for illegally profiting from his access.""

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Buyer with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, a permanent injunction, and an officer and director bar against Buyer. The complaint also seeks disgorgement from Buyer's wife, Joni Lynn Buyer, who profited when Buyer executed unlawful trades in her brokerage account. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Southern District of New York today announced related criminal charges.

The SEC's investigation has been conducted by Carolyn Winters and Timothy Halloran with assistance from Jessica Regan. The investigation has been supervised by D. Mark Cave. The litigation will be led by Mr. Halloran under the supervision of Melissa Armstrong. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.",SEC Charges Former Indiana Congressman with Insider Trading - Stephen Buyer allegedly used inside information to buy $1.5 million in stock,2022-07-25

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose on Monday morning, coming off a positive week for the major averages, as traders brace for the busiest week of corporate earnings, as well as insights into further interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 173 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.5% each as well.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the major averages fell on the back of weaker-than-expected earnings from Snap that sent tech shares tumbling. Still, all three benchmarks closed the week higher, with the Dow up 2%. The S&amp;P 500 advanced about 2.6%, and the Nasdaq capped the week up 3.3%.
*****
&gt; It was the second positive week in the last three for the major averages. The S&amp;P 500 has been attempting a comeback after falling into a bear market earlier this year. The index is currently up more than 8% from its 2022 and trading near the highest levels since early June.
*****
&gt; Investors shifted into risk assets last week after absorbing some strong corporate results that had Wall Street deliberating whether the bear market has found a bottom.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúEquities have managed to stage a rally MTD, and climb a wall of worry. The bounce has been led by cyclical and Growth stocks, helped by longer end yields stabilizing, which in turn eases the pressure on P/E‚Äôs,‚Äù Barclays‚Äô Emmanuel Cau wrote in a Friday note.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThis confirms to us that the market‚Äôs focus has switched from inflation worries to growth worries, with a sense that bad news is becoming good news again,‚Äù Cau added.
*****
&gt; As of Friday, about 21% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 reported earnings. Of those, nearly 70% beat analysts‚Äô expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Investors will face a stacked week of earnings ahead that will include reports from major tech giants Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will also conclude its two-day policy meeting. Economists are widely expecting a three-quarter point hike.

stocks,"  The Kremlin rejoices in every passing day of summer and already today is thinking in terms of winter-spring 2023. The main hope of the Russian leadership is that the population of European countries would experience serious discomfort due to the strictest savings of natural gas, oil, coal and other resources supplied to for decades from Russia. Also, Moscow believes that the seven packages of sanctions against the Russian Federation, introduced by the anti-Putin coalition, would harm not only Russia itself, but also the economies of Western countries. In addition, the Kremlin hopes that the resources and capabilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine would be exhausted before the winter, and the spirit of the Ukrainian people will be broken.

A protracted war, at least until the end of spring 2023, suits the Russian leadership quite well as an opportunity to study in practice the ability of Europe to live without energy from the Russian Federation, the ability of the Russian Federation to live without close economic ties with the West, and the ability of the Ramstein's coalition countries to assist the Armed Forces of Ukraine in confronting the RF Armed Forces.

Moscow launched a war against Ukraine using a mad push tactic, hoping to capture Kyiv in four days and the entire country in two weeks. Now the Kremlin has switched to ‚Äúsalami tactics‚Äù.

Russian Foreign Minister S. Lavrov admitted that Russia would claim as many Ukrainian lands as

Russian soldiers could capture. In Moscow, ‚Äúthe need to denazify the government in Kyiv‚Äù, ‚Äúprotection of the inhabitants of Donbas‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Western transformation of the Ukrainian state into anti-Russia‚Äù is no longer the reason for the attack on Ukraine. Lavrov stated bluntly that

‚Äúgeographical tasks will move further as Ukraine is pumped up with long-range weapons.‚Äù

Thus, Moscow will have no complaints about Kyiv only if Ukraine ceases to protect its territory from unprovoked aggression by totalitarian Russia, which is building a neoimperia. On July 17, the ex-president of the Russian Federation D. Medvedev threatened Ukraine with a ‚Äújudgment day‚Äù (probably meant the use of nuclear weapons), if the Armed Forces of Ukraine attack the decision-making centers, infrastructure, warehouses, ships and other places of dislocation of the occupation Russian army in Crimea. In turn, it seemed a little to the head of Chechnya R. Kadyrov (V. Putin's favorite) and promised to demilitarize the entire NATO block and capture not only Ukraine, but also Poland!

While the Armed Forces of Ukraine expect from their allies the heavy weapon, in order to get the opportunity to go on the offensive instead of the defence, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation slowly, mile after mile, cut off new pieces of the territory of Ukraine - in the Kharkiv, Kherson, Zaporizhzhya regions and in the Donbas. In general, the term ‚Äúsalami tactics‚Äù describes the constant use of limited failed facts to obtain and consolidate its influence. Instead of achieving the only decisive victory, the goal is to move step by step, providing a total winnings by minimal costs. It is believed that this term was invented in the late 1940s in Hungary in order to describe the actions of the Communist Party in the struggle for full power in the country. Then the parties were gradually destroyed, until only those politicians who agreed to cooperate with the Hungarian communists remained.

It is noteworthy that not so long ago, India accused the Chinese People‚Äôs Republic of insidious use of ‚Äúsalami tactics‚Äù, which provides with a quiet and gradual, but confident territorial expansion against India, Japan, countries of the South China Sea and other neighbors. In this regard, it is interesting that in October 2022, a fateful XX Congress of the Chinese Communist Party should take place. It will be dedicated to the future of the PRC at the geopolitical and geo-economic levels. It is possible that in Moscow they hope that in the fall of this year in Beijing, they would decide to strengthen the partnership of China and Russia, which is for some time has simply declarative nature.

Thus, Putin's Russia clearly declared that it was not afraid of delaying the war before the winter-spring 2023. The intrigue is to whether the West will be able to not weaken its sanctions influence on the aggressor and accelerate the supply of heavy weapons for Ukraine!?",Winter Is Coming,2022-07-25

stocks,"On July 21, the European Central Bank raised interest rates by 50 basis points. The European Central Bank raised interest rates for the first time in 11 years as it seeks to reduce inflation. This ended negative interest rates in the euro area. Previously, the euro zone's June CPI was 8.6%, a multi-decade high.

&amp;#x200B;

The European Central Bank's rate hike took the market by surprise. Analysts had expected a slight increase of 25 basis points. ""The European Governing Council believes that it is appropriate to take a larger first step on the path to normalization of policy rates than suggested at the last meeting,"" the ECB said in a statement on Thursday.

&amp;#x200B;

The euro rose to session highs at $1.0257 on news of a more aggressive rate hike. Italian 10-year bond yields also rose on the news, extending gains after reacting to Prime Minister Mario Draghi's resignation earlier on Thursday.

&amp;#x200B;

The euro zone is currently faced with two irreversible situations.

First, there is the recession of the Eurozone economy. Annual growth in euro zone energy prices was nearly 42% in June, compared with 39% in May. The sharp rise in energy prices has become the main culprit in European inflation, and high inflation will drag down the European economy.

In addition, the German economy is running a trade deficit for the first time, which means that the German economy, the strongest in Europe, has already experienced a severe downturn. The rest of Europe will be more difficult. In fact, the European economy is already in recession.

Raising interest rates is a double-edged sword. Although it can reduce inflation, it will also bring a bigger blow to Europe's sluggish economy.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, is the fall of the euro. The euro has fallen 11% so far this year. Compared with the peak of the euro in 2008, it has fallen by 36%. EUR/USD is almost 1:1, maybe in the near future, EUR/USD may fall below 1:1. The European Central Bank's interest rate hike can boost the euro in the short term, but it will hit the European economy even more.

The currency of a region will decline as the economy declines. And now, Europe is in the midst of its biggest crisis since the establishment of the euro zone.

The Ukrainian war is consuming the entire euro area, and even if the Ukrainian war ends, it will be difficult for the European economy to return to its pre-war situation in the short term.

At the same time, in the field of new economy (including the Internet, chip semiconductors, and new energy electric vehicles), European countries are significantly behind China, South Korea, Japan and other countries in Asia.

&amp;#x200B;

A recession in Europe is a foregone conclusion, and a recession in the European Union, one of the world's largest economies, will weigh on the global economy. For the stock market, it may also play a negative role.

stocks,"Been seeing a lot of people who just quote P/E ratio.

In-itself, P/E is just a metric and must be used in association with rather than being the sole decider of whether a stock is under or overvalued.

Businesses work in stages. 

1. Stage 1: Intro stage - Here, it is R&amp;D and their experimental product/service phase. They are likely losing tons of money and their P/E ratio will be negative despite being close to release.
2. Stage 2: Growth stage - Here, the company is ramping up production. Operating expenses are going to be high until they reach scaling. To reach scaling, they need to spend more money on expanding production capabilities. This will reduce their profits (if any) and result in a high P/E or negative P/E.
3. Stage 3: Mature stage - This is when a company has likely reached its mature stage. Production is scaled and efficiency is maximized to create profit and cash flow. This is the stage when it is best to use the P/E ratio because you are now comparing the efficiency of one company against another. At this stage, you can make a proper valuation with other tools on whether a company is overvalued or undervalued.
4. Stage 4: Declining stage - This is the stage where revenues are declining. Profits may still be up but because the stock price is falling due to negative sentiments and projected future of the company, the P/E ratio may still be high. Remember, P/E ratio is just a metric. It alone does not tell you whether a company is over or undervalued. It just spits out a number. As prices fall, the stock may seem undervalued but with declining revenues, profits are the next to go.
5. Stage 5: Death stage - This is when the company is pretty much on the verge of bankruptcy and will no longer exist in the future.

P/E ratio is useful but it's important to use it to compare companies in the same industry operating at the same stage of business. At the growth stage, a metric such as price-to-gross profit would be more useful than P/E, for example.",P/E Ratio: When it is and isn't useful -,2022-07-25

The official Whitehouse definition of recession was recently altered and changed to prepare for the impending negative GDP print later this week, which would, according to traditional well agreed upon definition of ""recession"", confirm we are infact in one.

Recession: a period of temporary economic decline during which trade and industrial activity are reduced, generally identified by a fall in GDP in two successive quarters.

I will go a step further and say the government will try their utmost to avoid acquiescing we are in a recession, such that it will ultimately cause a depression. It will likely be prolonged longer than the first gauffe.

stocks," On Monday June 7, 2021, shares of Scholastic (SCHL) rose 8%. They‚Äôd gain another 4.1% the following day.

The catalyst for the two-day rally was grim: chief executive officer, M. Richard Robinson, Jr., had passed away suddenly over the weekend.

Investors didn‚Äôt bid shares of Scholastic up because Robinson was a poor CEO. Rather, they did so because Robinson was not just the CEO, but the controlling shareholder. His passing opened the door to the sale of a company that even before the pandemic seemed to trade at a sharp discount to the value of its assets.

The surprising resolution of Robinson‚Äôs stake means that door is still open. Fourth quarter results last week suggest that the operating business retains significant value. Cash and owned real estate provides some downside protection if the bull case doesn‚Äôt play out.

There is a catch: SCHL has rallied a bit too far at the moment to be compelling. Shares have gained 22% over the last seven sessions. More than half the gains came on Friday, after Scholastic released a strong (and surprising) fiscal Q4 report that sent SCHL up 12%.

As a result, patience is advised. It‚Äôs possible SCHL reverses with or without the market. (The stock in fact did precisely that last June after the news of Robinson‚Äôs passing.) But given that a) the story is interesting b) we‚Äôve done the work and c) to be blunt, compelling ideas (either long or short) are not easy to find right now, we felt it prudent to lay out the bull case here, allowing investors to join us in keeping a close eye on the stock in the coming weeks.

**Scholastic At A Glance**

Founded in 1920, Scholastic is the world‚Äôs largest publisher of children‚Äôs books. It offers those books via standard distribution channels (bookstores, online, big-box retailers, etc.) as well as book clubs and book fairs at schools. The company also develops curricula for elementary school students, along with *Scholastic* magazine.

The company also owns substantial intellectual property. Most notable are its publishing rights to *Harry Potter* and *The Hunger Games*. Scholastic also owns properties like *Clifford the Big Red Dog*, *Goosebumps*, *The Magic School Bus*, and *Captain Underpants*, which are developed under its Scholastic Entertainment arm.

**Reasons For Caution**

That description alone highlights some of the risks here. A book publisher is not the kind of business that is going to garner a high valuation in any market, let alone this one. The reliance on book clubs and book fairs adds to potential top-line pressure.

Ostensibly, Scholastic can pivot away from traditional print sales to digital opportunities. But any investor paying attention for the last decade to legacy media companies (think television, radio, or even GameStop (GME)) will be keenly aware of how difficult those pivots are. Few have shown success, let alone met management expectations. Indeed, Scholastic‚Äôs own 2020 initiative contemplated a significant expansion of the company‚Äôs digital strategy. As we shall see, that hasn‚Äôt occurred to the extent hoped.

The two big franchises, *Potter* and *Hunger Games*, both appear to be over. *Potter* author J.K. Rowling [said as much](https://www.bustle.com/p/jk-rowling-explains-why-there-wont-be-any-more-stories-about-harry-potter-8900613) back in 2018. That series, in particular, was enormously profitable for Scholastic. In fiscal 2018, one year after the last Potter book was published, revenue and adjusted profit in Scholastic‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Book Publishing both declined more than 25%.

There‚Äôs also this problem: over two decades, on an annualized basis shareholders have gained only 1% in stock price appreciation and another 1% in dividends. A week ago 20-year *total* returns including dividends were 15%; payouts aside, SCHL had declined over that period.

Broadly speaking, the bull case for SCHL is that the stock is cheap, not that the business is particularly attractive. And for years now (with only a few exceptions) those cases simply have not played out. Perhaps in a bear market where valuation suddenly matters again, that will change.

Because the downside here seems reasonably well-protected, and a potential catalyst looms, there‚Äôs a case that SCHL might be the exception to the rule, or at least that the risk of a few years of \~dead-money returns is worth taking. (Our repeatedly-voiced skepticism toward valuations, even at this point in the market, adds to our comfort in taking that risk. 2% annualized returns may well represent alpha over the next 2-5 years.)

But that downside protection ‚Äî cash alone is more than 20% of the fully-diluted market cap ‚Äî also limits upside. So does the nature of the operating business. And so, like any good value play, valuation is paramount.

That‚Äôs why the rally of the past week does change the calculus here somewhat. Certainly, the Q4 earnings report implied a higher valuation, given strong guidance for fiscal 2023. But a 22% rally in the stock implies a \~30% increase in Scholastic‚Äôs enterprise value ‚Äî an obviously enormous move for a low-growth company. As we shall see, there‚Äôs still a case to be made for the stock, but it is more difficult to pound the table.

**The Succession Drama**

Incredibly, Scholastic went 101 years with two CEOs. Maurice R. Robinson (known as ‚ÄúRobbie‚Äù) began the magazine in 1920 and built the company from there. His son (known as ‚ÄúDick‚Äù) took over as CEO in 1975 and stayed in that role until his passing last year.

The family nature of the business appears to have kept Scholastic off the market despite [broader consolidation in the publishing industry](https://www.authorsalliance.org/2021/12/08/the-consolidation-of-publishing-houses-past-and-present/). In 2015, now-private Houghton Mifflin Harcourt purchased Scholastic‚Äôs EdTech business for $575 million. Per a *Value Investors Club* article published that year, HMHC said in its roadshow that it was rebuffed from [buying the entire company](https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/SCHOLASTIC_CORP/4209194685).

Last year, the *Wall Street Journal* [highlighted the succession drama](https://www.wsj.com/articles/succession-drama-grips-scholastic-ceos-sudden-death-an-office-romance-and-a-surprise-will-11627850787) that followed Dick Robinson‚Äôs passing. His brother William seemed to confirm the market‚Äôs long-running perception of Scholastic when he told the outlet:

&gt;Our family value was we‚Äôd rather not have the financial benefit that we might get from a sale if it means the company won‚Äôt be in the future what it was. Everybody knows Scholastic and has a good feeling about it and it does good things for teachers. It‚Äôs more than just a business for us.

The problem is that, for shareholders, it is just a business; ‚Äúgood feeling\[s\]‚Äù aren‚Äôt enough. Yet, owing to a dual-class stock majority owned by Dick Robinson, common shareholders couldn‚Äôt do anything but complain or sell.

Robinson‚Äôs death changed the blunt, unfeeling, financial calculus. Because, as the *Journal* reported, and Scholastic‚Äôs 2021 proxy statement confirmed, Robinson in his will [left all of his supervoting Class A shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000156459021043480/schl-def14a_20210922.htm) to Ms. Iole Lucchese. At the time of Robinson‚Äôs passing, Lucchese was a 30-year veteran of the company, rising to become Scholastic‚Äôs Chief Strategy Officer as well as the head of Scholastic Entertainment.

She was also Robinson‚Äôs ex-girlfriend, with a relationship that had gone on for some years, according to reporting from both the Journal and *Vanity Fair*. The bequest of the Class A shares to Lucchese bypassed both of Robinson‚Äôs children. (Lucchese is now chair of the board of directors as well.)

As the *Journal* reported in November, those children plan to contest the will. Notably, the financial adviser to Robinson‚Äôs ex-wife, Helen Benham Robinson, testified that, in 2009, Dick Robinson [agreed to give those shares](https://www.wsj.com/articles/scholastic-succession-lucchese-robinson-harry-potter-11637731535) to his sons in exchange for a $2 million loan. Benham Robinson has also said that Dick Robinson planned to update his will, though there‚Äôs no claim that he actually did so.

However this plays out, however, the idea of Scholastic as a family business likely is over. *Vanity Fair* reported in March that [Lucchese was now engaged](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/03/inside-the-succession-drama-at-scholastic), perhaps diminishing her loyalty to Dick Robinson and his family. Lucchese already has sold 300,000 common shares from the estate back to Scholastic at a modest discount to then-market price.

Should the Robinson sons somehow regain control of the Class A shares, their adherence to the family‚Äôs century-long devotion to the business seems questionable. In the Journal‚Äôs initial report, neither came off as particularly devoted to Scholastic ‚Äî and that‚Äôs both putting it mildly and skipping over the punchline.[1](https://www.overlookedalpha.com/p/scholastic-some-upside-left-eventually#footnote-1)

Indeed, the *Journal* later reported that it‚Äôs possible the two sons could each clear less than $1 million from the estate after taxes and executor fees (some of which are going to Ms. Lucchese). It seems likely that the Robinson family may thus support a sale if only in the name of (not-unreasonable but suddenly more pressing) selfish financial interest. (As far as I can tell, there‚Äôs been no news on the legal front since; Scholastic‚Äôs 2022 proxy statement, due next month, may provide more color.)

Obviously, when Dick Robinson passed away, investors did not know any of these facts. Rather, the 12% rally was a response to the idea that SCHL stock needed something ‚Äî anything ‚Äî to happen. Then and now, the market is not going to be moral or polite about what or how something happened.

**The Broad Case for Scholastic Stock**

The catalyst is important because, in some form, the current case for Scholastic stock has existed for years. The balance sheet has been a fortress since the EdTech sale; the company closed FY22 with $310 million in net cash on the books[2](https://www.overlookedalpha.com/p/scholastic-some-upside-left-eventually#footnote-2).

Notably, Scholastic also owns its headquarters building at 557 Broadway in Manhattan‚Äôs SoHo neighborhood. The company got an absolute steal, paying just $25.5 million in 2010. It acquired the neighboring building [for $255 million](https://commercialobserver.com/2014/03/scholastic-buys-555-broadway-for-255-million/) four years later, and then undertook a nearly five-year renovation of both properties.

In 2015, Madison Capital [agreed to pay $400 million](https://therealdeal.com/2015/04/17/madison-capital-partner-to-pay-400m-for-scholastics-soho-retail/) just for the rights to two floors of retail space on the properties. That deal wound up falling through, and post-pandemic real estate values in Manhattan are likely now lower for both office and retail square footage. But simply at cost (including renovations), the two buildings likely are worth at least that $400 million. (Before the renovations were completed, Scholastic had projected at least $10 million in annual rental income; the company hasn‚Äôt specified a figure since, though Robinson on the Q3 FY18 call said the revenues would ‚Äúadd significantly to our bottom line.‚Äù At a 6% cap rate it does seem like $400 million is fairly achievable.) Combined with the cash on the books, \~half of the market cap already is supported.

And there‚Äôs still the operating business, with a valuable brand, and still-valuable IP. Trade channel revenues totaled $344 million in FY22, up year-over-year after growth in FY21 as well; the 10-K attributes the growth [to previously published titles](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672922000017/schl-20220531.htm) as ‚Äúdemand for the Company‚Äôs best-selling series remained strong.‚Äù Scholastic Entertainment is having some success, with a live-action *Clifford* movie, the animated *Stillwater* on Apple (AAPL) TV+, and a live-action *Goosebumps* going to Disney (DIS) Plus.

There seem to be ways to find value here. A P-E firm could fund an LBO through cash on the books and a sale-leaseback of the SoHo headquarters. The fairs and clubs businesses, which still throw off cash flow, plus the backlist could fund any remaining debt; Scholastic Entertainment, digital and international efforts (including shipments to English-language schools in Asia) could provide potential growth drivers.

A leveraged recap might also make some sense. The company could provide liquidity to Lucchese (and/or the Robinson family, depending on how court cases shake out) in return for an end to the dual-class structure.

To be clear, the point here is not that financial engineering can create value. Rather, it‚Äôs that there are now options for the existing value to make its way to minority shareholders. Pre-2021, SCHL could and did look ‚Äòcheap‚Äô on paper, but it didn‚Äôt really matter all that much. The company was controlled by a CEO so devoted to the business that (as both the *Journal* and *Vanity Fair* noted) he met *both* of his wives *and* a long-term girlfriend there. That CEO was part of a family for whom, as his own brother put it, Scholastic was ‚Äúmore than just a business.‚Äù

At some point soon, however, it seems likely that it will be just a business. And so the question of what that business is worth suddenly becomes much more pressing, and much more interesting.

**Valuing Scholastic**

At Friday‚Äôs close of $41.66, Scholastic has an enterprise value of $1.17 billion. That‚Äôs a touch under 6x guided EBITDA for FY23 ($195 million-$205 million), guidance that appears to have driven the big post-earnings rally in the stock.

Peer comparisons here are close to impossible, but 6x EBITDA seems a reasonable multiple, and perhaps a touch cheap. Normalized free cash flow at the midpoint of the guided EBITDA range would be \~$120 million[3](https://www.overlookedalpha.com/p/scholastic-some-upside-left-eventually#footnote-3), valuing the operating business right at 10x free cash flow.[4](https://www.overlookedalpha.com/p/scholastic-some-upside-left-eventually#footnote-4)

On its face, 10x free cash flow perhaps doesn‚Äôt seem that attractive for a book publisher ‚Äî ostensibly a business that‚Äôs a bit of a melting ice cube. But it‚Äôs perhaps premature to believe that Scholastic earnings have peaked.

For one, those earnings certainly haven‚Äôt peaked yet. FY20 EBITDA was guided to $160-$170 million after the second quarter, and on the Q3 call (held on Mar. 18, 2020, right as the severity of the pandemic was becoming all too clear) Robinson said the company was ahead of plan. FY23 guidance implies $35 million in dollar growth from that interrupted outlook three years earlier. Admittedly, there were $50 million in permanent cost cuts imposed, but Scholastic also has dealt with the same inflationary issues as so many other U.S. businesses (along with currency impacts on the international business, which accounted for 18% of FY22 revenue).

Secondly, there are drivers here. As noted, Scholastic Entertainment has projects on the way. The book clubs business has been in decline since before the pandemic, due to secular trends and tax changes. (The 2018 Supreme Court decision that [forced e-commerce retailers to pay sales tax](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/21/why-amazon-wins-with-supreme-court-sales-tax-ruling.html) caught Scholastic in its wake.) But in FY23, Scholastic still only expects its fair count to reach 85% of the pre-pandemic total; revenue per fair in FY22 was above the FY19 level. Full normalcy there provides some incremental growth potential.

Scholastic‚Äôs new curriculum offering is showing success. International markets offer promise. Deferred revenue from digital subscriptions (per the 10-K) rose to nearly $20 million, as Scholastic found a measure of success on that front. Trade has grown for years now.

Scholastic is guiding for revenue to increase 8% to 10% this fiscal year; that‚Äôs not a sustainable long-term rate, but there is a pathway toward something like low-single-digit top-line growth beyond FY23.

Finally, there‚Äôs the question of how well the business is being run at the moment. The coverage of the succession drama also highlighted concerns about talent drain and management capabilities. (Some of the criticisms were aimed at Lucchese herself, most notably in her handling of the digital initiatives. However, there were differing accounts about how much responsibility she had for those efforts. Of course, that‚Äôs part of the point: for an effort as important as digital transformation, there shouldn‚Äôt be any confusion about whose brief it is.) As with the balance sheet, there is reason to believe that more financially-motivated ownership might do things differently ‚Äî and better.

Now, again, the move to $41 from $34 two weeks ago has changed the story. At 10x FY23 free cash flow, the story here can work, but at least as a standalone Scholastic needs to hit guidance and stabilize FCF from there. (My numbers suggest, in that scenario, the stock would be worth about $54, 29% above current levels. My sense, having followed this company since the middle of the last decade, is that kind of scenario is closer to a bull case than a base case.) At $34, that forward multiple drops down to 8x, and there‚Äôs much more of a case that a) the market is misreading the business and b) an acquirer can wring out big value in a hurry.

After Q4, it may be too much to ask for $34 again. (I‚Äôd hope for $38, at least getting one turn down in the P/FCF multiple.) Guidance, for now, dispels fears of a near-term decline in earnings. Until that outlook is proven optimistic (and it may well not be), it‚Äôs probably enough to keep investor interest ‚Äî and it‚Äôs probably enough to drive some upside ‚Äî even after the big gains of late. The question is whether ‚Äúsome upside‚Äù is the same as ‚Äúenough upside.‚Äù

# Netflix adds ‚Äúextra home‚Äù fee, will block usage in other homes if you don‚Äôt pay

## Netflix trials an extra home fee in some countries and extra member fee in others.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Four months ago, Netflix [began its crackdown](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/netflix-fights-password-sharing-with-test-of-3-extra-member-fee/) on password sharing by creating an ""extra member"" fee for users who share accounts with people they don't live with. The extra member fee of about $2 to $3 per month was implemented in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru, with Netflix saying it would evaluate the rollout before making changes in other countries.

On Monday this week, Netflix [announced](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/update-to-paid-sharing) a different kind of fee it will charge customers who share accounts. The new one requires customers to pay for ""extra homes"" and will be charged starting August 22 in Argentina, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.

""Beginning August 22, 2022, if your Netflix account is being used on a TV outside of your home, you will need to pay an extra $2.99 per month for each extra home. You will only be charged when you or someone who uses your account chooses to add an extra home‚Äîthis fee will NOT be automatically charged,"" Netflix [says](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926/hn) on its Honduras pricing page.

The fee for each extra home is also $2.99 a month in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In Argentina, the fee is 219 pesos per month (about $1.70 USD). Netflix [apparently is aiming](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/05/netflix-speeds-up-plan-for-ad-supported-tier-says-it-may-debut-this-year/) for a broader rollout of an account-sharing fee or fees by the end of this year.

For the anticipated worldwide rollout, Netflix has not said whether it will standardize on a single fee, offer users a choice between the extra home and extra member fees, or create some other option. Netflix aims ""to be as thoughtful as possible about how we charge for use across multiple homes"" and ""will not make changes in other countries until we better understand what's easiest for our members,"" the company said in yesterday's announcement.

With its revenue growth slowing, Netflix also plans to [create an ad-supported tier](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/04/netflix-plans-ad-supported-tier-amid-loss-in-users-and-plummeting-stock/) in addition to the streamer's current ad-free plans.

**Update**: Netflix said in its [earnings announcement](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/FINAL-Q2-22-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) on Tuesday that it now plans to roll out the ad-free plan and account-sharing fees in 2023, with the ad-free offering targeted for early in 2023.

## ‚ÄúTV will be blocked unless you add the extra home‚Äù

A ""[Netflix Homes](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/126602/ar)"" FAQ clarifies that users ""can watch Netflix on your laptop or mobile device while traveling"" and ""watch Netflix on a TV outside your home for up to two weeks as long as your account has not been previously used in that location. This is allowed once per location per year.""

Starting August 22, customers who sign in outside their home ""will see the option to add the extra home for an additional fee per month"" or use the two-week grace period, Netflix said.¬†Earlier today, the Netflix FAQ included a sentence that said after the two-week grace period, ""the TV will be blocked unless you add the extra home,"" as you can see in this screenshot:

 [(screen shot)](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/netflix-homes.jpg)

The sentence about TVs being blocked was removed, but it's still clear that customers will have to pay the fee to avoid being blocked in other homes.¬†Netflix said it detects extra homes using ""information such as IP addresses, device IDs, and account activity.""¬†To avoid messages that say ""too many homes are using your account,"" Netflix advises users to make sure ""the device is not connected to a VPN, proxy, or any unblocker service.""

Netflix will add an option to user account pages where they can ""review which TV or TV-connected devices are using your account by location, and sign out your account from a location."" Signing out of a location will sign out all devices associated with the location.

Netflix will limit the number of extra homes users can add based on their subscription plan. A subscriber on the Basic plan can add one additional home, a Standard-tier subscriber can add up to two extra homes, and Premium subscribers can add up to three extra homes.

Netflix's Basic, Standard, and Premium plans have monthly rates ranging from $7.99 to $13.99 in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The prices range from $9.99 to $19.99 in the US. The different tiers have pre-existing limits on how many people can watch simultaneously, but they are based on the number of screens rather than the number of locations.

As it turns out, Nancy's situation isn't all that unique. Many congress people see their wealth grow by thousands of percentage points after they're elected and the majority of our federal lawmakers are full-on millionaires.¬†


For reference, and I can't believe I feel the need to say this, most Americans not millionaires! So, where does all this money come from?¬†


Let's stick with Pelosi for a bit. There are a few ways she and other politicians make their money but the first one we obviously have to talk about is investment using Nancy's public records.¬†


Researchers at Open Secrets found that in 2018 she invested $46.5 million in real estate, another $15.8 million in electronics manufacturing, and a cool $15 million into just Apple, admittedly this doesn't tell us where the spending money first comes from, we'll get to that later but this information still matters a lot that's because, as it turns out, Nancy Pelosi is an investment genius.¬†


Investing and doing a bang-up job at it has been one of the big ways she and her husband paul have been able to multiply their fortunes during her tenure as a politician between 2020 and 2021.¬†


The Pelosi's traded over $50 million¬† in assets for an annualized return of 69%, nice!¬†


Now, that number doesn't mean anything to me except the obvious thing. So, I googled it and this is about six to seven times higher than the average stock market return, making her a better investor than Warren¬† Buffett, George Soros, and Kathy Wood, whose whole deal is investing!¬†


They don't spend any time holding elected office or anything.¬† The point is that these returns are incredibly lucrative, while millions of Americans fell into poverty because of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Pelosi's wealth grew by an eye-watering $16.7 million!¬†


So, of course, when a reporter asks her the question, ""Should members of Congress and their spouses be banned from tradingindividual stocks while serving in congress?""


She said, ""No!""¬†


Okay, Pelosi is an incredibly ""talented""¬† investor and it might be tempting to single her out, but none of this is all that unusual. It turns out, Congress¬† people have always been surprisingly good at investing!¬†


You might remember these four from the start of the pandemic in February. This¬† one wrote this article where he says, ""The¬† U.S. is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats,"" but then a week later he did this.¬†


Weird.¬†


Well, not really before the rest of us knew how bad COVID-19 would get, but after internal briefings by the CDC and Fauci on the severity of the upcoming Pandemic.¬†


These four senators dumped a whole bunch of money they held in the stock market right as it was about to crash. They all made hundreds of thousands of dollars presumably using information not disclosed to the public.¬†


But, hey now, maybe they're just really good investors?¬†


The DOJ certainly seems to think so, since all the investigations into what they did have since been closed.¬†


Seems reasonable.¬†


Here again, I want to be clear that what these senators did is not special. I had led with the people with names and faces, but this trend is bigger than four senators and the Pelosi's.¬†


Congress people have always been surprisingly good at investing!¬†


A five-month-long business insider investigation found that at least 49 members of congress and 182 high-ranking congressional staffers engage in insider trading.¬†


Multiple successive academic reports that looked into senatorial stock returns have consistently found that, overall, senators are just really good at beating the market!


Why? Well, if you look at a 2017 report by Public Citizen about senators and stock trading, you'll find that many individual senators often trade stocks in businesses that they oversee in their official capacity.¬†


I'm no expert but this might be a problem, no?¬†


What do I know? I should just listen to people like Pelosi who always know what to say and have the best explanations for why this isn't a problem.¬†


Truly airtight arguments because this is a free market.¬†


Makes sense to me. Everybody say thank you to Mrs. Pelosi for that valuable lesson in economics but fine what if investments and abuses of information couldn't explain any of the astonishing wealth of our politicians?¬†


Another good place to look is lobbying. Lobbying is a very very well-funded industry. In 2021, $3.7 billion were spent on federal lobbying alone.¬†


As you can see from this list the top spenders are almost exclusively businesses large industries and the firms that represent them.¬†


You can put that info on a graph and it looks like this, Labor and Citizen special interests represent almost nothing. If lobbying were a bag of Chex mix, you'd be getting like one rye chip per 50 handfuls of

pretzels.¬†


But, the thing with lobbying is that it doesn't work like an outright bribe. There's a lot of money in lobbying but in the grand scheme of things, the amounts that are actually spent mean very little to the politicians.¬†


While I can tell you that Nancy Pelosi got $180k from officially registered lobbyists,¬† she's not really getting that money for herself. That money mainly goes into campaign financing and then there's all sorts of amounts not on this list that go into things like, extravagant dinners.¬†



In any case, it's not where the millions of dollars in the Pelosi bank account are coming from, lobbying gets money into political hands in a much more indirect way that's sustained by a mutually beneficial relationship to get the wheels turning on this relationship.¬†


Lobbies will get close to politicians using a business's wealth to build rapport that can be translated into favorable legislation or outright subsidies essentially.¬†


They'll pay for ways to sit at the same table at a nice restaurant or get an hour in the right office.¬†


Why?¬†


Well, one study estimates that every dollar spent on lobbying returns an average of $760.¬†


If that number seems a little high to you, and it might very well be, regardless of what the actual amount is, it will always be more than what's put in.¬†


Businesses wouldn't lobby if it didn't serve them.¬†


But, that's just what businesses get from lobbying, what about politicians?¬†


Well, for politicians, the benefits of lobbying are split between long-term and short-term benefits.¬†


In the long term, politicians know that two-thirds of them will leave politics to enter the lobbying industry once their years in government will have made them very valuable assets to lobbyists and therefore come with a nice big bag of money with a dollar sign on it.¬†


That means that politicians spend years in office greasing the revolving door that'll let them leave government with lucrative jobs in the industries they cozied up to during their tenure.¬†


But, that's for the long term. In the short term, cozying up to lobbyists can come with other more immediate benefits.¬†


For example, in 2008, after VISA made a few small contributions to Pelosi's campaign, her husband paul was granted privileged access to a VISA IPO, where he was able to invest a large sum of money before stock prices went up and all Nancy had to do was stall the passage of a law that would cut into VISA'S PROFITS.¬†


Which she did.¬†


But fine, let's keep going and assume investment and lobbying mean absolutely nothing to these people's wallets.¬†


The reality is a lot of our politicians are just exceptionally wealthy right off the bat. While a lot of politicians use their office as an elevator into the upper strata, many others come in fully formed using government only to exaggerate their already impressive wealth.¬†


That's the case for the Pelosi's whose shared

finances are built on the venture capital firm that Paul founded. The company with probably the least googlable name in the world:¬† 

***FINANCIAL LEASING SERVICES***



I know I focused on the Pelosi's a lot in this video but this applies to like half our politicians and there's a reason for that.¬†


Being wealthy opens up a corridor to political life that being an average American just doesn't.¬†


At the personal level, being wealthy means you don't have to worry about keeping a full-time job while you run or making sure you have food on the table and a roof over your head.¬†


That's huge but that's not where the biggest benefits come from. The main reason the wealthy have such an easy time taking over politics comes from the fact that their incentives align with those of established parties.¬†


Political parties have an incentive to promote wealthier candidates and support them more because wealth begets wealth.¬†


Wealthy candidates come with wealthy connections that can be used to fundraise and finance ever more expensive campaigns.¬†


Wealthy candidates have a lot of friends who would all benefit from them winning and who will, therefore, be willing to raise money that parties can use to beat their opponents.¬†


Wealthy candidates also do not pose a threat to this model in a way that less wealthy more normal representatives do.¬†


If the only way you can get people into office is with generous checks from the wealthy, and that truly is the only reliable way to do it, then a candidate who opposes wealth of this kind threatens your party's whole electoral strategy.¬†


The wealthy do not want to finance a party that will take their dominant position in society away from them.¬†


People who do not look like you and me, who do not live the same lives, who do not face the same living conditions, make it into politics way more often just because it's easier for them than it is for a genuine representative of a country's citizens.¬†


Hence, this is why most Congress people are millionaires and most Americans aren't.¬†


And the thing is, there are real consequences. Our politics aredramatically influenced by all these different relationships to the capitalist class whether it's because of its disproportionate amount of seats at the table, its powerful use of lobbying, or the fact that it's in the best interest of politicians invested in the stock market to cater to capital.¬†


#These lpeople are not like you, they do not represent you, and they don't act in your interest.¬†


This doesn't mean that not a single law gets passed that protects those who work for a living, those laws just aren't the priority they get artificially delayed, pared down to the bare minimum, and written carefully to only sacrifice the short-term interest of capital for the long-term survival of the capitalist economy.¬†


What matters is not the individual battles, it's that the overall outcome doesn't threaten profitability, the balance of power is on their side.


Wrestling it away and putting that power back in the hands of the people is the. first priority.","How to become a better investor than Warren Buffett, George Soros, and Kathy Wood",2022-07-24

* Apple engineering manager Emily Schubert said 98% of new cars in the U.S. come with CarPlay installed. She delivered a shocking stat: 79% of U.S. buyers would only buy a car if it supported CarPlay.

* The auto industry faces an unappealing choice: Offer CarPlay and give up potential revenue and the chance to ride a major industry shift, or spend heavily to develop their own infotainment software and cater to an potentially shrinking audience of car buyers who will purchase a new vehicle without CarPlay.

* GM, which wasn‚Äôt listed on Apple‚Äôs slide, already gets revenue of $2 billion per year from in-car subscriptions and expects it to grow to **$25 billion per year by 2030**. 

* Tesla, which doesn‚Äôt support CarPlay, recently shifted into selling its ‚ÄúFSD‚Äù driver-assistance features, including auto-parking and lane-keeping, as a subscription that costs as much $199 per month.

* The next generation of CarPlay will need significant buy-in from automakers to give Apple‚Äôs software access to core systems. Apple suggested it secured cooperation from several major carmakers.

* In June, Apple revealed that it has explored features that integrate commerce into the car‚Äôs cockpit. One new feature announced this summer would allow CarPlay users to navigate to a gas pump and pay for the fuel from the dashboard of the car, according to Reuters.

This sounds like an incredible source of revenue. Of course there will be a lot of push back from car manufacturers who obviously want to keep this revenue to themselves. But Apple has the advantage of offering with integrations such as:

* iPhone obviously.
* Watch, which I believe will be a lot more popular in the future as more advanced healthcare capabilities are added to it.
* Apple home IOT networks.
* Apple's own entertainment content from Apple TV. I would not be surprised if Apple starts a movie studio 5 years from now or form some exclusive partnerships with maybe Disney.

stocks,"I've been a big proponent of Upstart stock because of the proven benefits. Its AI lending program is statistically superior to those that rely on traditional FICO scores. Their focus on subprime consumer loans is but a foray into lending markets that are orders of magnitude larger, such as car loans and mortgages. I was not a fan of their pandering to Wall Street by removing loans from their balance sheet, but I don't think it will derail them from their long-term goals. Best of all, their stock has been trading as if they're going to zero, when their financials are absolutely stellar. 

On TIKR Terminal, which I highly recommend for long-term, fundamental investors, analysts tend to agree, with estimates guiding for solid growth. However, they also predict serious setbacks in 2025, which would put a huge dent in their progress:

2022           2023          2024           **2025**         2026

Revenue:          1,083.23    1,379.37    2,107.31    **1,379.00**   1,57.00    *CAGR 9.3%*¬†¬†

*% Change YoY*    *27.7%         27.3%        52.8%*         ***(34.6%)***     *12.2%* 

This seems very strange to me, and I can't find any sort of reasoning behind it. For one, we're witnessing the credit cycle rollover as I type this. The macro environment couldn't be worse for them. Still, they are maintaining growth and have stabilized their lending program. Additionally, their AI is learning at a faster pace than ever as this cycle provides reams of data that might've otherwise taken years to accrue. What could possibly be the driver of such a catastrophic shortfall, specifically in the year 2025? I have no other idea outside the expectation for a repeat of this year's downcycle, with Upstart again falling prey to a collapse in debt markets. 

But the thing is, no one can predict these things--like, not in the slightest. 

My larger questions, therefore, are what goes into guidance like this, and how accurate are analysts at these ranges? My gut tells me the answers are 'random bullshit' and 'not very', but I honestly don't have access to the data. There are countless analysts, some better than others. I don't know which ones factored into the consensus estimates for Upstart on TIKR, not to mention the limitless estimates that go into stocks around the world, across a multitude of platforms, and at varying timeframes. 

There's no way they can predict what will happen with a company in ten, fifteen, thirty years. But even three years out seems impossible, quite frankly. Just look at the last three years, during which we experienced the fastest crash in history due to a global pandemic, the fastest recovery in history due to loose monetary policy that extended FAR past its expiration date, and therefore the biggest inflation shock in over 40 years. Zero people could have foreseen these macroeconomic events, let alone the effects they would have on individual companies. 99% of Reddit guaranteed the second Great Depression in April 2020--a year in which $SPY ended up rising 18%. 

So my last question to everyone here is: How do you manage guidance and estimates in spite of their horrific track record? 

A small slice of people are far better than others when it comes to investing. I tend to believe that this has to do more with emotional control and composure than intelligence and foresight regarding macroeconomic trends. There are traders who can use technical analysis to make 300% in a year, but they'll rarely beat a long-term investor that sits on their hands and lets their winners run upwards of 100X. That's why I keep buying during times like these, when people can't manage the red in their accounts and the comparisons between current totals vs ATHs. 

At the same time, sticking with a select group of stocks requires *some* sort of foresight, right? Or else, why would you pick that stock in the first place? To go back to the original example, I'm gobbling shares of Upstart now because it's not only fundamentally cheap, but also specifically *because* it's riding the downturn, and I want to buy closer to the bottom than the top. Also, they're miles ahead of any other AI lender, perhaps even decades, aside from maybe Pagaya, which operates in another sector anyhow. But I wouldn't deign to predict what's going to happen on a year-to-year basis. 

In the end, I wonder how much investing relies on luck vs. ability. The old saying ""time in the market beats timing the market"" sounds great, but not to the investor who threw their life's savings into tech stocks in November 2021. This is straight up luck, as inflation had just emerged as an issue, and no one truly knew it would be this pernicious--least of all the Fed. If these first-time investors view this experience as indicative of the market as a whole, they might eat their losses and never come back. Given their limited experience, were they bad investors, or simply unlucky? 

FWIW, I'm down 50% from the highs. I've always believed volatility is the price you pay for returns, and that the market over the long term goes up. But past performance has no bearing on future returns--or does it? Have my years of success indicated that I have a knack for picking stocks? Could Warren Buffett possibly have been lucky? How much experience is required to claim that one's success or failure is due to skill or a lack thereof?

stocks,"[Freightwaves article](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/ships-that-scrub-emissions-earn-twice-as-much-as-those-that-dont), non-paywalled. Read it over my post since it goes into more detail. But I'll give a shorter summary.

2020 regulations required ships to use a costlier, but environmentally friendlier type of fuel called ""low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO),"" with 0.5% sulfur content. This as opposed to high sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) with 3.5% sulfur content. The spread in costs are at all time highs, with VLSFO more expensive: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/SUYSKzO.png). ""The average price of VLSFO at the world‚Äôs top 20 bunkering ports was **$369.50 per ton higher** than the average price of HSFO on Wednesday, according to data from Ship &amp; Bunker. It reached an all-time high of $420.50 on July 5.""

However, by investing 2-3 million dollars, a ship can install a exhaust gas scrubber which allows them to continue using the cheaper HSFO. The cost savings are sizeable:

&gt; In bulk commodity shipping, the ship operator covers the fuel cost in a spot voyage deal, not the cargo shipper.  Clarksons Platou Securities estimated that 10-year-old very large crude carriers (VLCCs, tankers that carry 2 million barrels of oil) with no scrubbers, burning VLSFO, earned the equivalent of $16,200 per day in the spot market on Thursday.

&gt; The same ship, with a scrubber, burning HSFO, was paying **$22,000 less per day for fuel**, equating to a net day rate of $38,400 per day. 

&gt; In the dry bulk shipping sector, a Capesize (a bulker with capacity of around 180,000 deadweight tons) with no scrubber earned the equivalent of $22,000 per day in the spot market Thursday, according to Clarksons. **A scrubber-equipped Capesize saved $22,400 per day on fuel, thus netting twice as much: $44,400 per day.**

Currently, 

&gt; According to Clarksons data, 46% of container ships with capacity of 8,000 TEUs or more already have scrubbers, with more installations pending. Of ships 12,000 TEUs or larger, 59% are already equipped with scrubbers.

Here are some companies likely to benefit from this trend:

&gt; He believes Scorpio Tankers (NYSE: STNG) and DHT (NYSE: DHT) are the best positioned among public tanker companies to gain from scrubber installations, with Star Bulk (NASDAQ: SBLK) and Safe Bulkers (NYSE: SB) best positioned on the dry bulk side.

The reason?

&gt; However, some analysts maintain there could be more differentiation going forward. Companies with scrubber-equipped ships and/or vessels built in the last decade with more fuel-efficient designs could pull away from the pack.

&gt; ‚ÄúThose companies with exhaust scrubbers, particularly on larger ships, should outperform as the market becomes more bifurcated,‚Äù Nolan said.

The conclusion:

&gt; Historically, investors have seen little differentiation in company fleets, but that is changing. Those companies with a heavier focus on modern, eco-design ships [and/or scrubbers] are likely to see a premium valuation ‚Ä¶ due to the visibly strong outperformance they are now capturing.",Environmental regulations in the shipping industry have created a new competitive advantage: using higher (worse) sulfur content.,2022-07-24

The token community leans towards humor, and I am hoping for a more serious discussion.

Some highlights: 

\-The token is a security and is being designed to comply with Reg. D, Rule 506 (c). As such, this will only be open to accredited investors, and no part of this discussion should be construed as a solicitation or promotion.

\-The art is a png image of the actual share certificate. Sequential numbering makes each one unique. 

\-I believe this can be a viable fundraising mechanism for small businesses. Linking preferred shares to a token adds liquidity to the private placement market and increases the attractiveness and portability of preferred shares, which by themselves are not new at all. I am hoping the discussion focuses on the concept and the fundraising potential, not so much my particular company.

If people wish to discuss this, I will host the discussion elsewhere in order to comply with the rules on this site about the perception of self-promotion. There is presently a forum set up at my site. Please see the link above.

stocks,"The ECB raised interest rates for the first time, by 50 basis points. What are the implications for the economy and the stock market?

&amp;#x200B;

On July 21, the European Central Bank raised interest rates by 50 basis points. The European Central Bank raised interest rates for the first time in 11 years as it seeks to reduce inflation. This ended negative interest rates in the euro area. Earlier, the euro zone's June CPI was 8.6%, which has hit a multi-decade high.

&amp;#x200B;

The European Central Bank's rate hike took the market by surprise. Analysts had expected a slight increase of 25 basis points. ""The European Governing Council believes that it is appropriate to take a larger first step on the path to normalization of policy rates than suggested at the last meeting,"" the ECB said in a statement on Thursday.

&amp;#x200B;

The euro rose to session highs at $1.0257 on news of a more aggressive rate hike. Italian 10-year bond yields also rose on the news, extending gains after reacting to Prime Minister Mario Draghi's resignation earlier on Thursday.

&amp;#x200B;

The euro zone is currently faced with two irreversible situations.

First, there is the recession of the Eurozone economy. Annual growth in euro zone energy prices was nearly 42% in June, compared with 39% in May. The sharp rise in energy prices has become the main culprit in European inflation, and high inflation will drag down the European economy.

In addition, the German economy is running a trade deficit for the first time, which means that the German economy, the strongest in Europe, has already experienced a severe downturn. The rest of Europe will be more difficult. In fact, the European economy is already in recession.

Raising interest rates is a double-edged sword. Although it can reduce inflation, it will also bring a bigger blow to Europe, which has a sluggish economy.

German stocks have fallen 20% and are likely to continue to fall. Of course, this will drive the hot money from the European market to the US stock market.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, is the fall of the euro. The euro has fallen 11% so far this year. Compared with the peak of the euro in 2008, it has fallen by 36%. EUR/USD is almost 1:1, maybe in the near future, EUR/USD may fall below 1:1. The European Central Bank's interest rate hike can boost the euro in the short term, but it will hit the European economy even more.

The currency of a region will decline as the economy declines. And now, Europe is in the midst of its biggest crisis since the establishment of the euro zone.

The Ukrainian war is consuming the entire euro area, and even if the Ukrainian war ends, it will be difficult for the European economy to return to its pre-war situation in the short term.

At the same time, in the field of new economy (including the Internet, chip semiconductors, and new energy electric vehicles), European countries are significantly behind China, South Korea, Japan and other countries in Asia.","The ECB raised interest rates for the first time, by 50 basis points.

stocks,"Conflicting opinions are not met with thoughtful, constructive replies, but rather with downvotes and nasty comments of ""enjoy being in cash"" or ""enjoy getting demolished while I sit pretty on the sidelines"". 100% without fail.

You know, I think if people were more open to discussion we'd all be better off, ironically.  When I first started investing in 2021 I was skeptical, but in the end I think the people saying ""you can't time the market"" had some wisdom to what they said.  My portfolio is in the red, yeah, but it's not that bad and meanwhile I'm collecting dividends.  Emotionally speaking it also would have been very difficult to wait, I think.  I think there's some wisdom to ""VTI and chill"".  At some point watching the market go up and down every day takes a toll on you, at some point it's probably better just to get it over with and move on with your life. You can always add more later, and people saying that buying the dip will help you get back even quicker are probably correct.

That said, I was right about a few things myself. I correctly predicted that the bull market was unsustainable and that the end of QE would be the end of the rally.  I also predicted that QE and the high valuations it cause leaves us very vulnerable to shocks and black swan events - ie the war in Ukraine and inflation.  Some people might reply here ""well duh"", but that's not the case.  I remember people vehemently denying that any of this was possible, and taking the opportunity to downvote and dunk on me whenever I brought it up.

If anyone recognizes my name, I must admit that I myself haven't been perfect at this.  But I have tried my best to keep an open mind. 

Anyway, it's not that everyone's perspective is necessarily insightful or valid.  Some people really say stupid things.  Still, it seems our tendency is to always jump to the conclusion that any conflicting opinions are nonsense or garbage.  I don't think this is always the case.  I think people always have a reason to believe what they do, and if we all learned a bit of humility we might be able to learn from them.  I think that makes us better investors, and as cheesy as it may sound, better people, too.

I have a bad feeling that I will receive the normal hate on this post, or even that it will be removed for being off topic.  That would be a shame.

Pardon the ignorance, this might be a very simple question to answer.

I will use American Airlines as an example.

On April 14, 2022, American Airlines had 649,514,848 shares in issue, and the
stock closed at $19.00.

On October 18, 2019, American Airlines
had 438,057,971 shares in issue, and the
stock closed at $28.22.

So, the increase in the shares issued is
about 48.3% from 2019. This means that shareholders have been diluted by 48.3% from 2019 as well.

So in reality, if we take into account the
dilution, AAL's price of $28.22 in 2019 is
equivalent to about $14.67 in real terms when we count in the dilution.

Is that correct and is it that simple? Because if that‚Äôs the case, then theoretically one could suggest that American Airlines‚Äô equity has already pretty much recovered from their COVID-19 drop.

The goal is to capture a decent dividend given the economic climate for long term growth. What I see is all stocks will fluctuate with the market but stable, high dividend, less exposed stocks is the way to go.  Make sure you reinvest the dividends. 

NOW you won't make the money that people who invest in the big swings stocks and prospect stocks get but you will have a stable nest egg. 

If we look at certain companies who pay dividends and make consistent revenue and profits, with the uncertainty happening right now, in my opinion it will recover, so you will get the price back + dividends that hopefully beat inflation.

Ford has an okay dividend but depending on how the execution of electric cars will be a deciding factor. **BUT meanwhile** Monsanto will earn hand over fist in cash no matter what. Alcoa who produces aluminum, will also be safe for a very long time (yes tariffs and trade can affect them but they are not going anywhere).

# **Markets face what could be the most important week of summer with Fed, earnings and economic data - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/22/markets-face-what-could-be-the-most-important-week-of-summer-with-fed-earnings-and-economic-data.html)**
*****
&gt; There‚Äôs a head-spinning amount of news for markets to navigate in the week ahead, the biggest of which will be the Federal Reserve‚Äôs midweek meeting.
*****
&gt; The two largest U.S. companies ‚Äî Microsoft and Apple ‚Äî report Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. Google parent Alphabet releases results Tuesday, and Amazon reports Thursday. Meta Platforms, formerly Facebook, reports Wednesday. In all, more than a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies are reporting.
*****
&gt; On top of that are several hefty economic reports, which should add fuel to the debate on whether the economy is heading toward, or is already in, a recession.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúNext week, I think, is going to be the most important week of the summer between the economic reports coming out, with respect to GDP, the employment cost index and the Fed meeting ‚Äî and the 175 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings,‚Äù said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.
*****
&gt; Second-quarter gross domestic product is expected Thursday. The Fed‚Äôs preferred personal consumption expenditures inflation data comes out Friday morning, as does the employment cost index. Home prices and new home sales are reported Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think what those bigger companies say about the outlook will be more important than the earnings they post. ... When you combine that with the statistical reports, which will be backward looking, I think it‚Äôs going to be a volatile and important week,‚Äù Grohowski said.
*****
&gt; The run-up to the Fed‚Äôs meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday has already proven to be dramatic, with traders at one point convinced a full point rate hike was coming. But Fed officials pushed back on that view, and economists widely expect a second three-quarter point hike to follow the one last month.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúObviously a 75 basis point hike is baked in the cake for next week,‚Äù said Grohowski. ‚ÄúI think the question is what happens in September. If the Fed is continuing to stay too tight for too long, we will need to increase our probability of recession, which currently stands at 60% over the next 12 months.‚Äù A basis point equals 0.01%.
*****
&gt; The Fed‚Äôs rate hiking is the most aggressive in decades, and the July meeting comes as investors are trying to determine whether the central bank‚Äôs tighter policies have already or will trigger a recession. That makes the economic reports in the week ahead all the more important.
*****
&gt; # GDP report
&gt; Topping the list is that second-quarter GDP, expected to be negative by many forecasters. A contraction would be the second in a row on top of the 1.6% decline in the first quarter. Two negative quarters in a row, when confirming declines in other data, is viewed as the sign of a recession.
*****
&gt; The widely watched Atlanta Fed GDP Now was tracking at a decline of 1.6% for the second quarter. According to Dow Jones, a consensus forecast of economists expects a 0.3% increase.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWho knows? We could get a back-of-the-envelope recession with the next GDP report. There‚Äôs a 50/50 chance the GDP report is negative,‚Äù Grohowski said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the simple definition of two down quarters in a row.‚Äù He added, however, that would not mean an official recession would be declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which considers a number of factors.
*****
&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, expects to see a decline of 1.9%, but added it is not yet a recession because unemployment would need to rise as well, by as much as a half percent.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs two negative quarters in a row, and a lot of people are going to say ‚Äòrecession, recession, recession,‚Äô but it‚Äôs not a recession yet,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe consumer slowed quite a bit during the quarter. Trade remains a huge problem and inventories were drained instead of built. What‚Äôs interesting is those inventories were drained without a lot of discounting. My suspicion is inventories were ordered at even higher prices.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Stocks in the past week were higher. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week with a 2.6% gain, and the Nasdaq was up 3.3% as earnings bolstered sentiment.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really shifting gears in terms of what‚Äôs going to be important next week versus this week,‚Äù said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. ‚ÄúWe really had an economic data that was largely ignored. Next week, it will probably equal the attention we pay to the household names that are reporting.‚Äù
*****
&gt; # Better-than-expected earnings?
&gt; Companies continued to surprise on the upside in the past week, with 75.5% of the S&amp;P 500 earnings better than expected, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Even more impressive is that the growth rate of earnings for the second quarter continued to grow.
*****
&gt; As of Friday morning, S&amp;P 500 earnings were expected to grow by 6.2%, based on actual reports and estimates, up from 5.6% a week earlier.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe have kind of a perfect storm of inputs, pretty deep economic reports across the board, with things that have become important, like consumer confidence and new home sales,‚Äù said Hogan ‚ÄúFor me, the real tell will be whether the attitude of investors continues to be that the earnings season is better than feared.‚Äù
*****
&gt; While stocks gained in the past week, bond yields continued to slide, as traders worried about the potential for recession. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.76% Friday, after weaker PMIs in Europe and the U.S. sent a chilling warning on the economy. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI do think the market is pivoting,‚Äù said Grohowski. ‚ÄúI do think our concerns at least are quickly shifting from persistent inflation to concerns over recession.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The potential for volatility is high, with markets focused on the Fed, earnings and recession worries. Fed Chair Jerome Powell could also create some waves, if he is more hawkish than expected.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThere are a lot of signs out there about slowing economic growth that will bring down inflation. Hopefully, the Fed doesn‚Äôt stay too tight for too long,‚Äù said Grohowski. ‚ÄúThe chance of a policy error by the Fed continues to increase because we continue to get signs of a rapidly cooling ‚Äî not just cooling ‚Äî economy.‚Äù

&gt; # August is the worst DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1988

&gt; August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 34 years, 1988-2021 with average declines ranging from ‚Äì0.3% by Russell 2000 to ‚Äì0.8% by DJIA. For NASDAQ August ranks second worst over the same period with an average gain of 0.3%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b075626ea3874e2fc116db33a8761fd5/0055cd9c0de3cf55-22/s500x750/15499d85ea532121b439c6e81fa8a9943d381a24.jpg))**

&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1988; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998, with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%‚Äîwhich is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts‚Äô average decline.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2654ca71d08f8fd0df6b99fb95d9b9a2/0055cd9c0de3cf55-b6/s400x600/43a701788e7e1289967b0870c0c5c46b873c75d6.jpg))**

&gt; In midterm years since 1950, Augusts‚Äô rankings improve slightly: #8 DJIA and S&amp;P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1974), #5 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1982). Average losses range from ‚Äì0.2% for S&amp;P 500 to ‚Äì1.3% for Russell 2000. Russell 1000 has advanced 0.2% on average in midterm Augusts. All five indexes having winning track records, but losses have frequently been substantially larger than gains. DJIA and NASDAQ suffered double-digit losses in 1974, 1990 and 1998.

&gt; # Third Longest Streak of Negative Bull-Bear Spread on Record

&gt; Last week, over a quarter of respondents to the AAII sentiment survey reported bullish sentiment for the first time in over a month. As the S&amp;P 500 has made a considerable move to the upside, bulls have continued to come back this week rising to 29.6%. The percentage of respondents reporting as optimistic has now come back within one standard deviation of its historical average and is at the highest level since the first week of June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072122-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment has fallen in lockstep with the increase in bullish sentiment. After coming in at over 50% two weeks ago, the reading has shed 10.6 percentage points. Albeit improved, bearish sentiment remains well above the historical average and the double-digit two-week decline is actually the seventh of the year. In other words, the sharp drop in bearish sentiment is not exactly unusual compared to other moves this year as it still has further to go until it reaches a more ""normal"" level.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072122-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Regardless, with inverse moves in bulls and bears the bull-bear spread has risen to -12.6. That is the highest reading since the first week of June and, as shown in the second chart below, the 16th consecutive week with bears outnumbering bulls. Clearing two other streaks from the early 2000s, that is now the third longest streak on record behind the 22 and 34-week-long streaks ending in December 1990 and October 2020, respectively.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072122-AAII-Streak.png))**

&gt; Not all of the losses to bears went to bulls. Neutral sentiment also rose this week rising to 28.2% from 26.6% last week. That is the highest level in three weeks as neutral sentiment has generally been less volatile than bulls and bears recently.

&gt; # Declines Abound in Mortgage Data

&gt; Roughly one month ago, the national average for a 30 year fixed rate mortgage peaked above 6%. Since then, the rate has pulled back and stabilized around 5.75% in the past several weeks. Although mortgage rates have stabilized a bit, they remain at some of the highest levels since 2008 and have been heading marginally higher in the past week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072022-MBA-30y.png))**

&gt; Given the slight rise in rates, demand for mortgages continues to predict further weakness in upcoming home sales data as we noted in today's Morning Lineup. The MBA's Mortgage Purchase index released this morning came in at a slightly lower reading than the June 3rd low for the weakest reading in the index since March and April of 2020. This week's low is also below the range from the few years prior to the pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072022-MBA-Purch.png))**

&gt; Not only has there been a lower volume of mortgages being applied for, but the actual dollar value of those loans has also plummeted amidst higher rates. As shown below, the average value of purchases reached a high of $460K back in March after a big increase in the first few months of this year. Since then, it has entirely reversed that move with the average value of loans having fallen all the way back down to $406K. That echoes the findings in other recent housing data which has similarly shown declines in home prices.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072022-MBA-Value.png))**

&gt; Higher rates have had an even more significant impact on refinance activity. Following another drop this week, the MBA's index tracking refinancings has now reached the lowest level since November 2000.

&gt; # Speculators Head for the Hills

&gt; As we do each Monday in our Closer report, we reviewed the latest data from Friday's release of the CFTC's Commitments of Traders (CoT) Report. This data shows how speculators are positioned in various assets based on positions in the various futures contracts. One asset that has seen some of the most notable changes of the report in recent weeks has been the S&amp;P 500. As recently as one month ago, that data showed a net 1.29% of open interest was positioned long. Even though the S&amp;P 500 has managed to come off the lows in the past month, positioning has collapsed with a massive move lower meaning there are far more speculators positioned short than long.

&gt; Whereas one month ago the reading was net long, in the latest data as of last Tuesday a net 9.3% of open interest was short. That made for the lowest reading since October 2015. In other words, speculators are positioned more pessimistically now than they were during the COVID crash, during the late 2018 near bear market, or any other time over the past several years. The change in positioning has also been rapid. As shown in the second chart below, that net positioning reading has fallen over 10 percentage points in just 4 weeks. Earlier this year in March there was an even larger 12.5 percentage point decline but prior to that, looking back through the history of this data, such large moves have been much rarer over the past decade than was the case in the 2000s and before. In fact, prior to this year the last time positioning in S&amp;P 500 futures fell double digits in four weeks was all the way back in August 2011. On the other hand, the early 2000s frequently saw moves of this size if not larger.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071922-COT-SP.png))**

&gt; Typically, sentiment data is considered contrarian in nature. In other words, pessimistic sentiment readings are followed by stronger forward performance of equities and vice versa. That has not exactly been the case for this CoT positioning data. Following past declines of at least 10 percentage points, returns have been mixed.

&gt; After declines of similar magnitude, the S&amp;P 500 has experienced modest outperformance over the next week. One and three months out, however, have tended to be weaker with postive returns only half the time with negative returns on an average basis. Over the next month, each of the past four instances have been followed by declines.

&gt; Six and twelve months out have seen the S&amp;P 500 higher two-thirds of the time, but average and median returns are not significantly better relative to all periods.

&gt; # More Small-cap weakness likely as Russell 2000 enters historically weakest part of year

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8fd703b64f2ab0d42bb9b829b105a769/3ff497f2b81cc1bf-69/s500x750/97c22df40bbed926529f6e903d4037d7b7431a50.jpg))**

&gt; In the above chart, 43 years of daily data for the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies are divided by the Russell 1000 index of largest companies, and then compressed into a single year to show an idealized yearly pattern. When the graph is descending, large caps are outperforming smaller companies; when the graph is rising, smaller companies are moving up faster than their larger brethren. Small-caps have historically peaked versus large-caps in late-May to early June and tend to underperform until sometime in the fourth quarter.

&gt; # Best Performers Since Mid-June Low

&gt; Since June 16th, the market has reversed course higher, making the date at least a near-term bottom. From a technical perspective, the Russell 1000 broke through its 50-day moving average yesterday and broke above its upper downtrend line today. The 50-DMA is still moving lower, but this is the first time that the Russell 1000 has been above the 50-DMA since April 20th. However, the index is still 9.7% below its 200-DMA. These moves come as commodity prices have pulled back and earnings season begins.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/Russell-1000-Index-Chart-072022.png))**

&gt; As we highlighted in a Chart of the Day earlier this week, the lagging sectors during bear market declines tend to be the leaders in bear market rallies, which is holding true in the bounce since 6/16. The table below shows the 20 best performing stocks in the Russell 1000 Index since the 6/16 low. As you can see, these stocks are all still down considerably on a YTD basis, declining a median of 50.1%. However, these stocks have rebounded by a median of 42.1% since the low on 6/16. Only one of these stocks is below its 50-DMA, and only two are above their respective 200-DMA. If you think that the bear market has concluded, these would be some of the names worth looking deeper into.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/R1000-Stocks-Best-Since-616-072022.png))**

&gt; On the other hand, the best performing sectors during bear market declines tend to be the worst performing sectors during bear market rallies. Of the 20 worst performing Russell 1000 stocks since 6/16, 14 belong to the energy sector (which has been the best sector on a YTD basis by a wide margin). On a median basis, these 20 stocks are still up 13.6% on a YTD basis, but they've shed 13.7% of their value since the market bottomed in mid June. Notably, these stocks (on a median basis) are closer to their 200-DMAs than they are to their 50-DMAs. If you think that we are currently in a bear market rally that is bound to reverse course, these names would be worth looking deeper into.

stocks,"The market is currently predicting that the Fed will cut interest rates next year. There can be multiple reasons for this:

1. Inflation has peaked and growth is slowing, so the Fed will cut to support the economy.
2. Bond market is predicting a recession and going to safety (bonds)
3. The bond market is getting ahead of itself and will have to reverse if the Fed signals they are not stopping/slowing rate hikes next year.

From my perspective, there are too many crosscurrents to make a reasonable determination of why bond yields are down and expectations are for rate cuts next year.

Concurrently, as the market prices in rate cuts for next year, forward inflation expectations are slowly rising. This could lead to the start-stop issue during the inflation of the 1970's, where Central Banks would raise rates to quash inflation, and as inflation came down a little, they would pause or cut rates, driving inflation right back up again, making it a structural issue until Volcker came along.

I'm hoping the Fed won't make the same mistake here until the data really shows inflation is meaningfully coming down.

I'm curious to see what everyone else thinks about the market pricing in rate cuts for next year means, and if it's bullish or bearish for stocks.","How realistic are rate cuts next year, and is it really bullish?",2022-07-22

stocks,"  Apparently, Putin's Russia, waging a not very successful war against Ukraine, is not afraid to raise the stakes and may escalate its conflict with the West.

On July 21, the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation (the upper house of the Russian parliament) did not rule out the opening of a second front - in Transnistria, and threatened a catastrophe for the Moldovan statehood. It was stated that the US and the EU were trying to turn the Republic of Moldova into a second Ukraine, pumping it with Western weapons. It was also suggested that it was precisely the patronage of the West over the authorities in Chisinau that prevents Moldova from dealing with a long-standing problem - the uncontrolled Transnistrian region, - where Russian troops have been stationed for 30 years. At the same time, no one in the Federation Council remembered that in 1999, Russia pledged to withdraw all the weapons and the entire personnel of its military contingent from the territory of Transnistria until 2003, in accordance with the decision of the Istanbul Summit of the OSCE.

The same day, the Russian Foreign Ministry complained that the Moldovan authorities once again detained Russian officers at the airport in Chisinau, who were heading to the unrecognized ‚ÄúPridnestrovian Moldavian Republic‚Äù (‚ÄúPMR‚Äù) to replenish the peacekeeping contingent. At the same time, the main headquarters of the Russian Ground Forces stated that Moldova was blocking the supply of Russian military equipment to Transnistria by all means, hoping for the inevitable combat wear of the Russian contingent.

On July 20, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the ‚ÄúPRT‚Äù announced that the armed conflict between the ‚ÄúPRT‚Äù, strongly supported by Russia, and the Republic of Moldova could be resumed (for the first time since 1992). The so-called president of the quasi-state entity in separatist Transnistria, Vadim Krasnoselsky, has showed teeth and warned that NATO member states could be involved in an escalating conflict in the region, bringing them into direct military confrontation with Russia. Naturally, the ‚Äúauthorities‚Äù in Tiraspol, first of all, had in mind the involvement of Romania in the conflict, since Romanians and Moldovans belong to the same ethnic group and speak the same (Romanian) language. Also, Tiraspol unreasonably and without evidence accused Chisinau that Moldova creates barriers for the import of food, fuel, medicines, fertilizers and industrial equipment to the ‚ÄúPMR‚Äù.

Shortly before this, ex-president Dmitry Medvedev has expressed his great dissatisfaction with

Moldova (now holding the post of deputy head of the Security Council of the Russian Federation). He specifically wrote that ‚Äúin case of a serious mess, Russia will be ready to protect 220 thousand citizens of Russia living in Transnistria.‚Äù He also expressed a number of threats to Moldova due to the fact that in Chisinau considered the opportunity to join the sanctions against the Russian Federation, conducted by the anti - Putin coalition of the Western countries and their allies. The first thing D. Medvedev promised to do was to completely block Moldova supply of Russian natural gas and other resources.

In addition, the Russian Federation's establishment really does not like other things in Chisinau: the President of Moldova Maia Sandu and her ‚ÄúParty of Action and Solidarity‚Äù (PAS), which control the legislative and executive power, adhere to democratic and liberal values and want to enter the EU, not the EAEU (led by the Russian Federation); M. Sandu has announced the need to modernize the army, explaining this by a real threat from Putin's Russia; in Chisinau, the pro-Russian ex-president Igor Dodon and his minions are now being judged for corruption; Moldova blocks the rotation of Russian troops in the ‚ÄúPMR,‚Äù and constantly insists on withdrawing the Russian contingent from the left bank of the Dniester.

At least, Ukraine, the European Union and the United States should be prepared for such a development of events when totalitarian Russia attacks another sovereign democratic state.",Does Moscow set Transnistria on fire?,2022-07-22

#[Nasdaq futures slide as Snap results weigh on technology stocks](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/21/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news-.html)

*****
&gt; Nasdaq futures fell Friday as investors digested a fresh batch of corporate earnings that included disappointing results from Snap, which sent social media shares reeling.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 traded 0.3% lower, while S&amp;P 500 futures slipped 0.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 42 points, or 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Those moves follow what has been a strong week for markets, fueled by a rally in tech shares. The Nasdaq Composite is on course to close out the week 5.3% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track for a 2.4% weekly gain, while the S&amp;P 500 is set for a 3.5% gain.
*****
&gt; Shares of Snap plummeted a whopping 28% in extended trading after the Snapchat parent posted second-quarter results that fell short of analysts‚Äô expectations and noted that it plans to slow hiring. The report was followed by a slew of analyst downgrades on the stock.
*****
&gt; The results from Snap weighed on other social media and technology stocks investors feared could get impacted by slowing online advertising sales. Shares of Meta Platforms and Pinterest fell 4.4% and 6.3% in the premarket, respectively, while Twitter and Alphabet each lost more than 2%.
*****
&gt; The Invesco QQQ Trust slid 0.58% after hours.
*****
&gt; Nearly 21% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported earnings so far. Of those, 70% have beaten analyst expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; The news could ruin what has been a hot streak for tech shares. The Nasdaq Composite posted its third straight positive session on Thursday. That came on the back of positive quarterly results from Tesla, which popped nearly 10% on Thursday.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq finished the regular trading day Thursday 1.36% higher to close at 12,059.61, while the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.99% to 3,998.95. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 162.06 points, or 0.51%, to settle at 32,036.90.
*****
&gt; Shares of growth-focused technology companies jumped in trading on Thursday as the dollar cooled down from its surge. The European Central Bank hiked rates by 50 basis points in its first increase in 11 years while initial jobless claims hit their highest level since November 2021.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThis is showing you that market expectations are really low, that a little bit of good news can go a long way when you have low expectations,‚Äù said Truist‚Äôs Keith Lerner, noting that investors rotated back into growth stocks even amid this weak economic data.

stocks,"I need help from someone who really knows their stuff about stocks. 

I have considered investing for a while now and I just started a new job at a financial company that has a benefit of being able to purchase stock in the company at a discount of 5%. It is also a payroll deduction so you apparently don‚Äôt have tax consequences for doing so until you sell your stocks and gain income as a result. 

I don‚Äôt know anything about stocks, but I do know that I believe in the health and growth of my employer and so I think this may be a good idea for a small investment. 

My questions: 

1. Can someone explain to me like I‚Äôm a kindergartner how I make money off of stocks?

2. I make $18 an hour and I‚Äôm working on building up savings. At this tax bracket and financial situation and whatnot, does it make sense to invest in stocks? 
2b. Does it make sense to invest in stocks if there‚Äôs a good possibility that the only stocks I will invest in are my company‚Äôs / does it make sense to invest in stocks if you aren‚Äôt going to diversify your portfolio? 

3. Is it true that I won‚Äôt have any tax consequences at the end of the year if I haven‚Äôt sold my stocks and made an income? I normally file with TurboTax and I don‚Äôt want to have to purchase one of the paid versions just because I bought these stocks. 

4. I‚Äôm only looking to make a small investment for now until I am more comfortable with the knowledge about stocks and investing and whatnot, but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to make such small of an investment that it‚Äôs pretty much inconsequential. With that being said, I can invest in increments of 1% of my pay to 25% of my pay‚Ä¶right now, that equates to around $14.40 a paycheck to $360 a paycheck, but I‚Äôm probably only comfortable with investing between (1%) $14.40 and (2%) $28.80 per paycheck right now. Is it even worth it to invest so little in stocks? Would you invest 1% or 2%? 

5. Do you have any ‚ÄúStocks for Dummies‚Äù type resources to share with me so I can become more educated on the topic?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

stocks,"Bei seinem Treffen mit Erdogan gestern im Iran dankte Putin dem t√ºrkischen Staatschef sogar f√ºr die Erleichterung des Transfers von gestohlenem ukrainischem Getreide.

Insgesamt werfen die ukrainischen Beh√∂rden Russland vor, mindestens 400.000 Tonnen Getreide aus den besetzten Gebieten gestohlen zu haben, wodurch der Ukraine ein Schaden von mindestens 100 Millionen Dollar entstanden ist.

Insgesamt befanden sich in den vor√ºbergehend besetzten Gebieten etwa 1,3-1,5 Millionen Tonnen Getreide. Der ungef√§hre Marktwert dieser Getreidemenge belief sich auf mindestens 300 Mio. USD, was fast 7 % der gesamten Getreidemenge entspricht, die die Ukraine vor dem Krieg exportieren musste.

Vor dem Krieg lief der Hauptstrom der Getreideexporte aus der Ukraine √ºber die Seeh√§fen, die die Ausfuhr von 5-6 Millionen Tonnen Lebensmitteln pro Monat erm√∂glichten. Derzeit wird Getreide aus den besetzten Gebieten Saporischschja und Cherson auf zwei Wegen exportiert, die jedoch beide auf die Halbinsel Krim f√ºhren: mit der Eisenbahn und mit speziellen Lastkraftwagen - Getreidetransportern.

Au√üerdem versprechen die russischen Beh√∂rden in regelm√§√üigen Abst√§nden, dass auch der Hafen von Berdjansk f√ºr diesen Zweck genutzt werden soll. Ukrainisches Getreide wird auf der Krim im Hafen Avlita in der Hafenbucht von Sewastopol verladen.

Getreide wird von der Halbinsel nicht nur aus Sewastopol, sondern auch aus den H√§fen von Feodosia und Kertsch exportiert. Und von dort aus fahren sie mit Schiffen in die T√ºrkei, nach √Ñgypten und Syrien, oft nicht unter russischer Flagge. Es ist bekannt, dass die Russen etwa 100 Tausend Tonnen gestohlener Lebensmittel allein nach Syrien exportiert und daf√ºr bereits 25 Millionen Dollar erhalten haben.

Ein weiteres Ziel f√ºr ukrainisches Getreide ist die T√ºrkei. So wurde etwa am 13. Juni ein russisches Schiff, das Fedor, im Hafen der t√ºrkischen Stadt Bandirma festgehalten: An Bord befanden sich mehr als achttausend Tonnen Mais.

Nach dem Fedor in der Stadt Samsun, entfernt Ermittler das Schiff Sormovsky-48 mit dreitausend Tonnen Mais. Und in der Stadt Eskenderun lieferte das Trockenfrachtschiff Mikhail Nenashev 27.000 Tonnen Getreide. Am 1. Juni ging das unter russischer Flagge fahrende Trockenladungsschiff Zhibek Zholy, das der kasachischen KTZ Express Shipping geh√∂rt, in Karasu (T√ºrkei) vor Anker.

Er transportierte auch gestohlenes ukrainisches Getreide. Aber es ist nicht nur Getreide, das die Russen in der Ukraine stehlen. Ende M√§rz und Anfang April meldete Agrotek-Invest, der offizielle H√§ndler des amerikanischen Landmaschinenherstellers John Deere in der Ukraine, den Diebstahl von Maschinen von einem Ausstellungsgel√§nde in Melitopol.

""Agrotek machte f√ºr den Diebstahl von 27 Maschinen ""Kadyrowiten"" verantwortlich - K√§mpfer der tschetschenischen Milit√§reinheiten, die als Teil der russischen Truppen in die Ukraine kamen. Was die Russen nicht stehlen k√∂nnen, zerst√∂ren sie und unterminieren damit die ukrainische Wirtschaft.

So beschossen die Russen am 7. Juli die Region Saporischschja, was zu einem Brand auf den Weizenfeldern f√ºhrte, der sich anschlie√üend auf die Region Dnipropetrowsk ausbreitete - das Feuer vernichtete 200.000 Quadratmeter Getreide. Dies geschieht fast t√§glich. Einer Studie der Kiewer Wirtschaftshochschule zufolge kostete die russische Invasion den ukrainischen Agrarsektor 4,3 Milliarden Dollar durch zerst√∂rte Ausr√ºstung, besch√§digtes Land und nicht geerntete Feldfr√ºchte.

In den Oblasten Luhansk, Cherson und Saporoschje setzen die Russen jetzt in gro√üem Umfang ""Aufseher"" f√ºr die Bauern ein und schaffen bedingte Kolchosen, die die Herausgabe des gesamten Eigentums verlangen. Diejenigen, die nicht einverstanden sind, werden get√∂tet.

Nach Angaben von Serhiy Gayday, dem Leiter der OVA Luhansk, gab es einen Fall, in dem ein Mann bei einem Treffen mit √∂rtlichen Landwirten den Bedingungen der Russen nicht zustimmte. W√§hrend des Treffens stand er auf und sagte, dass er sich weigere, ihren Forderungen nachzukommen.

Am n√§chsten Tag wurde er get√∂tet. Es liegt auf der Hand, dass die Situation, die sich in den beschlagnahmten Gebieten entwickelt hat, zu einer Umverteilung von Eigentum und einer √úbernahme von Unternehmen f√ºhren wird. Die daraus resultierende zunehmende Kriminalisierung wird zu Ernteeinbu√üen f√ºhren und die weltweite Ern√§hrungssituation verschlechtern.","Die Russen rauben weiterhin ukrainische Bauern aus, w√§hrend die T√ºrken die Verbrechen vertuschen",2022-07-22

Recently, we're in a bear market, recession looms although a lot of investors say we're coming back to actuality, that is a healthy economy again. All is going to go well. Second, and finally, before all other variables, I propose, take a look at their competition. It's everywhere. Streaming, Pharmaceuticals, Health Care now . . .

stocks,"Ever since the influx of retail investors over the past couple years, there are a lot more newbies on these boards and I hear a lot of phrases misused or quoted incorrectly. Here are a handful I've seen that, by debunking/clarifying, hopefully saves people some trouble:

  
**Misconception #1: 'Invest in what you know - Peter Lynch'** 

This one is wrong out of omission. Peter Lynch never said that it was sufficient criteria for you to invest in a product or company **only because** you were familiar with. It was merely a starting point. You still need to do research on the fundamentals, like profitability and valuation, before you actually decide to invest in it. 

**Misconception #2: Time in the market beats timing the market**

I hear too many people use this to justify stock picking. This should only be used when talking about buying the market itself, i.e index funds. Just because you hold a stock for 5 years doesn't mean it'll rise in that time, and if you make solid profits or see a good entry point based on valuation, then you should definitely sell or average down respectively. A company's prospects could change on a dime and one should be prepared to act accordingly. What time will allow, however, is median reversion, but that could go in either direction depending on if the stock is trading cheaply or richly. 

**Misconception #3: The stock went down after I bought it, so I was wrong and/or the stock went up after I bought it, so I was correct.** 

Investing is at least as much about having a strong stomach is it about being smart/correct. Too many people feel complacent after their stocks or the market does well and feel downtrodden after the market crashes. The price is just what the market is willing to offer you to buy or sell. It is not an indication of the 'correctness' of your decisions. The market price is simply a means of selling things that are trading at a premium to your calculated value, or buying things trading at a discount. 

If something you bought 'on sale' becomes even cheaper, and nothing else has worsened about the picture other than market volatility, then one should be inclined to average down. And likewise, if something rises far above what you think a stock's intrinsic value is, selling would be prudent. (unless one is holding for long-term capital gains, but that's another story) If you don't have a price target yourself (not an analyst's), then you should calculate one before you initiate a position. 

**Misconception #4: The company's doing great, so it must be a great buy!**

A great company does not make a great investment. Valuation always matters in the end. If you buy a company performing amazingly like most tech/growth companies in 2021, but buy them at 50x sales, then you're going to have a bad time. Eventually, when valuations matter again, they will crash, as they did this year. There have been far too many story stocks over the past decade, with amazing industry prospects, but basically no fundamentals to speak of. 

And even the profitable companies were trading at a sharp premium. Look at Costco, which is still trading for over 30 P/E, despite being a slow-growing company. That's effectively a 3% rate of return in a highly inflationary environment. Even if they grow earnings at 10% a year (which is unlikely), it'll take a long time for your money to double. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Tldr:** Fundamentals matter, and if you don't want to do the research, index funds are a great way to get the returns of the market. But if you hold a stock for a long time, you'll get the returns of the business at the valuation you bought in at. Returning to the median works both ways, in that you'll lose money if you bought at a premium, and you'll gain money if you bought at a discount. And none of these principles apply to trading, which is a separate beast altogether. Anyway, happy investing!

I strongly recommend reading through what I wrote and also some of the comments in the Investing Sub post. I basically made a case for buying Citi since it seemed ridiculously underpriced. I backed my predictions with DCF analysis and such.

Anyways, I'm posting this because it seems that many of my predications have since come to fruition. For some reason, many believed that Citi's Q2 financials would be underwhelming due to inflation and such. Therefore, in the weeks before Citi released their Q2 financials, Citi's stock price fell to prices as low as $43/share. However, as I pointed out in my original post, rising interest rates are **good** for banks like Citi. Then on July 15th, 2022, Citi released their Q2 financials and the stock price has since soared from $43/share to prices currently around $52/share. Citi's Q2 performance wildly exceeded expectations, largely due to rising interest rates being profitable for them.

I apologize if this comes off as conceited. I don't mean to brag.

However, even with this sudden spike in price, it still seems a bit undervalued. In my original post, using DCF Analysis, I arrived at an ""intrinsic value""/intrinsic share price of $254.68/share. Not only that, but even in my ""worst-case scenario"" future free cash flow projections, I still arrived at an ""intrinsic value"" of $56.55/share. Both of these values are higher than the current share price.

However, as many comments in the original thread pointed out, it's probably not a good idea to use DCF analysis to value banks. Many suggested using the dividend discount model (DDM) instead. Using the DDM model, I came up with an intrinsic value of $70.16/share, which is far closer to the actual price. But that still means that the stock is still moderately undervalued.

Many in that thread also suggested other methods to calculate an intrinsic value such as P/E and P/B. Seeking Alpha multiplied consensus analyst estimates for FY22 by the average valuation multiples for P/E, P/B, and P/TBV of Citi and its peers, and calculated a price target of $81.13/share. For some reason, Seeking Alpha links are not allowed on this sub, but this can be found in the Seeking Alpha article titled ""Citigroup Q2 Earnings: Outperforming Peers And Expectations""

They also seem to agree that the stock is still undervalued.

However, there are some reasons why Citi might not be a good buy. This year, Citi decided to freeze its dividend hikes to build its capital buffers. This stagnating dividend may deter investors from this stock despite their financials improving. However, its dividend yield is still at 3.92%, making it one of the highest in the industry. But this dividend freeze is due to a relatively poor Stress Test results, with Citi displaying lackluster capital buffers. This is a reason to think more carefully before deciding whether to go all in on Citi. But that seems like a minor issue in the grand scheme of things.

Warren Buffett recently invested an **enormous** amount of money into Citi. His ""stamp of approval"" bodes well for the future of this stock.

Overall, Citi is still a good buy. It would be very surprising if its price does not increase to $80+ in the near future. What do you guys think? Is Citi a good buy?",UPDATE: It seems that the market is finally beginning to realize that Citi is ridiculously underpriced,2022-07-22

&gt; It is to be signed on Friday in Istanbul by Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.

&gt; The world shortage of Ukrainian grain since Russia's 24 February invasion has left millions at risk of hunger.

&gt; The invasion sent food prices soaring, so the deal to unblock Ukraine's ports is crucial. Some 20 million tonnes of grain is stuck in silos in Odesa.

&gt; Ukraine's foreign ministry confirmed that another UN-led round of talks to unblock grain exports would take place in Turkey on Friday - and a document ""may be signed"".

Snap shares plummeted more than 20% in extended trading on Thursday after the social media company reported disappointing [second-quarter results](https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/Snap-Inc.-Q2-2022-Earnings-Release-vF.pdf) and said it plans to slow hiring as it reckons with weakening revenue growth.

Co-founders Evan Spiegel, the CEO, and technology chief Bobby Murphy agreed to new employment contracts that will keep them in their jobs through at least January 2027.

Here‚Äôs how the company did:

* **Earnings per share**: A loss of 2 cents, adjusted, versus expected loss of 1 cent, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts
* **Revenue**: $1.11 billion versus $1.14 billion expected, according to Refinitiv
* **Global Daily Active Users (DAUs)**: 347 million versus 344.2 million expected, according to StreetAccount

In its investor letter, Snap said it‚Äôs not providing guidance for the third quarter because ‚Äúforward-looking visibility remains incredibly challenging.‚Äù The company said that revenue so far in the period is ‚Äúapproximately flat‚Äù from a year earlier. Analysts were expecting sales growth of 18% for the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.

‚ÄúWe are not satisfied with the results we are delivering, regardless of the current headwinds,‚Äù the company said in the letter.

It‚Äôs the latest chapter in a tough year for Snap, whose stock has lost almost two-thirds of its value in 2022. In May, Snap said it wouldn‚Äôt [meet](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/24/snaps-down-32percent-and-its-dragging-other-stocks-down-with-it.html) the second-quarter guidance it set the prior month, leading to a [43% plunge](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/24/snaps-down-32percent-and-its-dragging-other-stocks-down-with-it.html) in the share price.

stocks,"NFLX shares have plunged in 2022. The chart below illustrates the performance of Netflix shares year-to-date compared to a few peers, Roku ROKU and Disney DIS.

&amp;#x200B;

Subscriber Slowdown &amp; Rising Competition

&amp;#x200B;

A rapidly increasing number of digital streaming services has no doubt impacted Netflix. A few of these streaming services include Amazon Prime Video AMZN, Apple TV AAPL, Roku ROKU, and Disney+ DIS.

&amp;#x200B;

These services have been gaining rapid traction, making the industry much more competitive. Simply put, Netflix is no longer the go-to streaming service that it once was for many people.

&amp;#x200B;

Peeling back the pages, in 2021 Q4, the company provided disappointing guidance that it expected new subscriber adds of 2.5 million in 2022 Q1 vs. the consensus of seven million expected.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where the trouble began.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward to 2022 Q1, and the company reported losing more than 200,000 subscribers in the quarter. It was the company‚Äôs first subscriber loss in a decade, and the market priced in this growth slowdown ‚Äì shares plunged 35% the following day.

&amp;#x200B;

Netflix provided further disheartening guidance, forecasting a drop of two million subscribers in 2022 Q2. It seemed that NFLX investors just couldn‚Äôt catch a break.

&amp;#x200B;

However, Netflix posted a much stronger than expected earnings report yesterday, reporting that it had lost fewer subscribers than the previous guidance of two million.

&amp;#x200B;

In turn, NFLX shares soared in pre-market trading. Let‚Äôs break down the earnings release to see if Netflix shares are worth another look amid a growth slowdown.

&amp;#x200B;

Q2 Earnings Recap

&amp;#x200B;

Netflix reported quarterly earnings of $3.20 per share, good enough to pencil in a sizable 10% bottom-line beat and exceed the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $2.90. Quarterly revenue of $7.9 billion came in marginally under expectations but reflected an 8.6% year-over-year change.",The Q2 earnings report is positive for Nlfx.

stocks,"As with anything Tesla, I'm seeing lots of comments containing false information getting upvotes, saying they ""bought high and sold low"" or made a big loss on their Bitcoin. I just wanted to clarify that this is not the case:

Tesla sold 10% of their total BTC in March 2021 as a liquidity test at a profit. Then they sold 75% of their remaining BTC this quarter in May, at around the same price they bought it for. On the EC they mentioned they made a slight profit, but it was offset by their impairment.

As for that, the way BTC accounting works is that you are not allowed to recognise any profits until you sell. So if you buy at $10k and BTC goes to $100k, the profit in your books is $0. Once you sell, you are allowed to recognise that profit.

On the other hand, if it drops below your ""carrying value"", you do need to recognise that impairment. So if you bought for $10k and it drops to $5k, you need to take a $5k loss on your earnings. If after that it goes back to $10k, you're still ""carrying"" it for $5k until you sell. You're not allowed to recoup your losses in the books until you sell. If at any point it goes below the lowest it's been while you were holding it (so $5k in this example), you again need to take an impairment in your books. As a result, Tesla had to mark down their carrying value in Q3 2021 as BTC dropped to ~$30K, which was their carrying value until Q2 and right around where they sold.

So in short, they made a small profit on the 75% they sold this quarter, but because the other 25% dropped roughly 35% below their carrying value (to $17.760), generating a ~$115M impairment (again, can just calculate this based on the earnings report), that offset the gains from the other 75%.",Tesla did not sell their BTC at a loss,2022-07-21

-EVs are exploding in use and popularity. Basically every major car maker plans to transition to EV fully within the next two decades. 
-More pressure will most likely be added to change to EVs sooner rather than later. The heat waves, especially in Europe, are flashing the warning signs about the dire climate crisis. 
-Rapid expansion. All of these companies have expanded rapidly and/or have partnerships with major companies to expand. 

Quick look at the companies, starting with EVGO. 

-EVGO, Flying J and GM have a partnership and plan to install hundreds of charging stations across the country. 

EVGO makes money by selling electricity to consumers. They partner with businesses to put charging stations there. It costs more to charge, but it charges faster than the competitors. 
EVGO has increased its revenue each of the past 3 quarters, yet it is still not profitable. Cramer also said he likes it, so there‚Äôs that‚Ä¶. 

Blink Charging: has over 30,000 charging stations worldwide and increasing quickly. New installs are up 46% YOY and revenue is up, yet still not profitable. Blink also has a partnership with GM. 

Charge point: focuses more on selling hardware and subscriptions. The largest one here, it is focused on growing its network and will likely not be profitable until 2024.

stocks,"BlackRock Inc. is used to breaking records. The world‚Äôs largest asset manager was the first firm to break through $10 trillion of assets under management. But the bigger they are the harder they fall. And this year BlackRock chalked up another record: the largest amount of money lost by a single firm over a six-month period. In the first half of this year, it lost $1.7 trillion of clients‚Äô money.

BlackRock management was quick to invoke the first-half market carnage when revealing the investment performance last week. ‚Äú2022 ranks as the worst start in 50 years for both stocks and bonds,‚Äù Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said on his earnings call.

While few firms are able to avoid what the market throws at them, some at least try to overcome it. BlackRock is increasingly giving up: At the end of June, only about a quarter of its assets were actively managed to beat a benchmark -- rather than track it seamlessly as passive strategies are designed to do. That‚Äôs down from a third when BlackRock acquired Barclays Global Investors in 2009 to become the leading player in exchange-traded funds.

Within the equities business, the divergence is especially pronounced. Across the industry, assets have leached away from active strategies and into passive. In BlackRock‚Äôs case, around $21 billion has flowed out of active equity in the past decade, with $730 billion flowing into indexed equity. The firm‚Äôs passive equity holdings are now 10 times larger than its active business, although it does operate some active multi-asset and alternatives strategies that narrow the gap.

For portfolio managers on the fixed-income side, the evolution of the business portends an ominous future.

stocks,"Tesla seems to be abandoning its ten-figure bitcoin bet amid a severe slump in cryptocurrency markets. 

The electric-car maker said on Wednesday that it has sold approximately 75% of its bitcoin as of June 30. It said it converted $936 million worth of the cryptocurrency into fiat between April and June. 

Tesla made waves ‚Äî and sent the price of bitcoin skyrocketing ‚Äî when it announced a $1.5 billion investment in the cryptocurrency in February 2021. A company of Tesla's stature placing such a big bet on the burgeoning and volatile crypto market was unprecedented. Tesla held onto much of its stake as bitcoin soared to new heights by the end of 2021.

But the value of bitcoin has plummeted since amid a wider economic downturn. The currency has lost more than 50% of its value this year and took another sharp dive on Wednesday afternoon following Tesla's announcement. 

Elon Musk's automaker said it still holds $218 million worth of the digital currency. It justified its initial purchase by saying that it was looking into liquid assets that had more upside than cash. 

Tesla said it made $272 million on bitcoin sales early last year. Add that to the $936 million it offloaded this quarter and the $218 million it still held at the end of the quarter, and Tesla comes out roughly $74 million in the red on its bitcoin bet. 

Tesla reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, beating analyst estimates but logging its first ever quarter-over-quarter decline in profit. A coronavirus lockdown in Shanghai severely limited Tesla's ability to produce vehicles at its factory there, cutting its overall sales for the quarter

Just curious what others thoughts on the impact this will have on sentiment and markets when this is confirmed (or possibly not) next week.

There are many posts on this sub discussing climate change in the context of investing in renewables. But it's apparent, from the crisis in Ukraine, that the world much more easily shifts to wacky (and admittedly necessary) policies like labeling gas as a ""green"" project. It seems increasingly likely that we're royally fucked.

There are a [handful](https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jfi8zd/stocks_that_benefit_from_the_next_crisis_climate/) [of](https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qbhtx2/best_stocks_for_growing_income_inequality_and/) posts discussing stocks to invest in based on worsening climate change, but they are generally low effort. 

Obviously gas companies will benefit, but beyond the most obvious what companies or sectors are likely solid, long-term investments as climate change worsens? 

I don't any specific companies (which is why I'm asking), but for categories I would off-handedly suggest any infrastructure companies. Most of the built environment is designed for a very specific temperature and climate range. But that range is changing. For example, officials had to wrap the Hammersmith Bridge in London in reflective foil to keep it from crumbling.  The recent heat wave also melted a runway at Luton Airport. 

Secondly, I would suggest climate control companies - air conditioning and heating seem like viable sectors.

stocks,"As a small investor, I really can't afford to lose money.  Losing even $10 is, well, a meal to me.  Losing even more on investments, taking weeks, months, even years to recover is a bad, bad strategy.  Yet, at the same time, I'm no different than anyone else.  That is, I cannot merely NOT invest because our dollars are continuously devalued even in a ""normal"" climate, and they lose value MUCH faster when the Fed stimulates us.

So, all of that aside, I remember the days when you'd call up your broker and tell them you knew of a growing company that was about to go public, to have an IPO.  If you got in early, there was a good chance that your dollars would help provide the funds necessary to grow the company, and naturally the founders would capture some of those fund, but employees who helped create and grow the company and it's products would also own a share, and common shareholders would also ""win"" when the company truly did use the funds to expand, innovate, and grow.

Now, it seems very different.  And IPO quite often will enrich just the people at the top.  Even employees are cut out from the rewards, but executives and fund managers and accountants and board members will become instant millionaires or even more.  Then, the company's stock valuation begins to plummet, and common shareholders lose their asses... err, excuse me, they lose their assets.  The losses can be HUUUGE.  And because I've seen that happen so many times in recent years, I've steered clear of IPOs.

Anyhow, it had me thinking.  I imagine a lot of small investors still pour in as common shareholder, hoping they'll experience some success for the same reasons us old timers did back in the day.  And, it seems reasonable that as they get into the IPO, they get trapped.  They aren't going to bail out, sell at a loss, when the rapid bleed down starts.  So if the common shareholders aren't letting the price slide.  Who is?  Who has so many shares that they can sell off and bleed down the valuation, they're willing to let their shares go for less and less and less.  Who can afford to take on such losses?

I'm building a spreadsheet in google docs ( [https://imgur.com/a/zKGqGuj](https://imgur.com/a/zKGqGuj) ), in order to make a brief overview of a company X.

My idea is to have 4 tabs as you can see below:

* Business Overview: Simple overview of the business, easy to read and easy to consume, yet informative.
* Checks: List of some important points about the company, for example Debt ratios, growth ratios, share dilution etc.
* Simple DCF: Simple discounted cash flow or other method used to value the company.
* Notes: Notes about what I am thinking at the moment, comment on the results, leave something recorded.

So my question is, in the business overview sheet, what would you add more/remove?

This is meant to make a mini study about the company in order to consider if it is worth doing another deep dive or discard :)

If you want too, you can comment on which of the ratios/checks are most important to you! I'm sure I'll miss something, thank you!!!

stocks," Moscow has high hopes that soon the Ukrainian people will get tired of the war, and the population of European countries will get tired of helping Ukraine and strict adhering to its own sanctions imposed against Russia seeking to build a new empire. At the same time, the Kremlin is acting cunningly and cleverly in its own way, since it does not hope for weariness purely from military operations in Eastern Europe. The leadership of the Russian Federation is making great efforts to cause and exacerbate as much as possible three crises on the entire European continent: energy, food and migration.

Naturally, Moscow persistently offers Brussels, Berlin, Paris and other influential actors in the European arena to help overcome the crisis (if we are talking about migration) or even completely eliminate it (speaking of energy problems). But! It is in exchange for a significant easing of sanctions pressure. Accordingly, if the European Union, Great Britain and other states of the anti-war coalition continue their course of assisting Ukraine in repelling external aggression, the leadership of the Russian

Federation will tirelessly look for new ways to intensify the three crises mentioned.

This is what German Chancellor O. Scholz tried to convey to his audience in a column for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on 07/17/22. According to him, restrictions against the Russian Federation will remain for a long time and this will certainly cause certain difficulties for the Germans and other European peoples, however, V. Putin's neo-colonial course must be stopped! He also clarified that restrictive measures would not be lifted from the Russian Federation, even if it manages to impose a peace treaty on Ukraine on unfavorable terms for the latter.

The German Chancellor explained that if the external aggression of the Russian Federation is not stopped today in Ukraine, then tomorrow the Kremlin will send troops to those states that it considers its sphere of influence - Georgia, Moldova and the Baltic countries. Moreover, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are members of NATO, so tomorrow the war may already be between Russia and the Alliance. As O. Scholz emphasized, if the countries of the West and their allies do not punish the Russian Federation today, then tomorrow it will mean that force can violate the law without consequences.

At the same time, the head of the government of the country, which is the strongest and most prosperous economy of the EU, honestly warned the Germans and all Europeans that a new crisis (already the fourth one) is approaching, which, however, is of an objective nature - the crisis of the global economy. Of course, it has many causes distributed all over the planet - from China to Venezuela (although it is clear that the war unleashed by the Russian Federation only spurs the global recession). Therefore, the German Chancellor summed up that no country in the world can stand alone against such a development of events!

Reacting to such a position of European politicians, the Russian concern Gazprom sent out official notices to its customers in Germany and Austria that it could not guarantee gas supplies via the Nord Stream-1 pipeline due to extraordinary circumstances beyond its control. Naturally, if O. Scholz had written a column in which he called for mitigating restrictions against the Russian Federation, Gazprom would have forgotten about some force majeure circumstances.

There is no doubt that Moscow will play such games with all Western countries, looking for certain ‚Äúweak points‚Äù in them and offering its ‚Äúfriendly help‚Äù in exchange for lifting sanctions. Well, well, that is precisely why the anti-war coalition is helping to restore the territorial integrity of Ukraine in its selfless struggle against totalitarianism and neo-colonialism.",War and crises,2022-07-20

Cathie Wood is closing down one of her exchange-traded funds, the first time her Ark Investment Management has pulled the plug on an ETF. 

The St. Petersburg, Florida-based firm is shutting down its ARK Transparency ETF (CTRU), which launched at the end of last year, according to a regulatory filing. With holdings like Teladoc Health Inc. and Spotify Technology SA, the fund aimed to invest in companies that received high scores on transparency. 

Ark said in a statement that Transparency Global, which shaped the fund‚Äôs underlying portfolio, will stop calculating the index at the end of July.

‚ÄúWhile Ark investigated alternative index providers, it did not find a suitable solution and decided to close the fund,‚Äù according to the release.

The fund gained only $12 million in assets since inception, a fraction of the $9 billion in Wood‚Äôs flagship fund. It was a rare passive vehicle from Ark, whose active offerings boomed in popularity during the pandemic, with Wood hand-picking stocks that she saw as shaping the future of finance, healthcare and other industries. 

‚ÄúThis seemed like an odd fit to me from the beginning,‚Äù said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, an investment adviser. ‚ÄúArk made their name by focusing on active management and disruptive innovation. The ARK Transparency ETF was at odds with that approach.‚Äù

The transparency fund‚Äôs price has dropped more than 30% since its debut in late December. It will no longer accept creation orders after Thursday and won‚Äôt accept redemption orders after July 26, the filing showed. 

It‚Äôs been a difficult year for investors in growth strategies. Wood‚Äôs ARKK has plunged more than 50% as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and fears of a recession grow. Since December, Ark has lost almost half of its assets under management.",Cathie Wood‚Äôs Ark Shutters Transparency ETF in First Closure,2022-07-20
stocks,"Hi, this is not another bull-or-bear up-or-down question. I'd like to run a sanity check on the entitlement offer by ANZ Bank (in Australian market). Full investor pack can be found [here](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/trade-our-cash-market/announcements.anz). TLDR version:

ANZ is buying another business and is raising capital via entitlement offer. 

1. 1 new share for every 15 existing shares
2. Offer price is $18.90 vs last close $21.64

My understanding is, the maximum damage (share dilution) is 1/16 = 6.25%, which means as long as the share price is above $20.16, it will make sense to exercise the offer. Does it work like that? Or as long as the share price is above $18.90, I should just exercise?

I guess another way to ask the question is, does the share price get adjusted (similar to ex-dividend date) after these newly issued shares are added?

stocks,"The U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted to move ahead with a slimmed-down version of legislation to provide billions of dollars in subsidies and tax credits for the semiconductor industry, hoping to ease a shortage that has disrupted production in industries from automobiles to electronics and high-tech weapons.

The Senate backed by 64 to 34 a procedural measure setting the stage for potential votes to pass the legislation in the Senate and House of Representatives by the end of next week.

The bill is part of a broad effort across the government to push back against a rising China and ease supply-chain problems, in this case by decreasing U.S. companies' reliance on foreign-made semiconductors.

The final text was not released before the procedural vote, but Senate aides said the measure includes about $54 billion in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor companies, as well as a new, four-year 25% tax credit to encourage companies to build plants in the United States. The tax credit is estimated to be worth about $24 billion.

Officials from President Joe Biden's administration had urged Congress to pass a semiconductor bill before leaving Washington for their annual August recess, saying it would not only create and preserve U.S. jobs, but also bolster national security.

I‚Äôm a newbie trader. Since I'm just starting off, I'm still learning about charts and indicators, been watching a lot of strategies and lessons on Youtube. I also look after calls from news sources and recommendations from experts. I currently rely on what little knowledge I do have, and, to be honest, I tend to entrust my trades to different financial analysts frequently. However, I feel like I am failing to improve my trading skills. I am sick of hearing supposedly knowledgeable people repeatedly make incorrect predictions while still being asked for their advice.

My brother's longtime trader friend told me this weekend that participating in prediction competitions is a great way to improve your trading abilities. He encouraged me to join so I could practice, test my abilities, and get better at making high-probability trades. He has been actively participating in numerous stock and cryptocurrency prediction tournaments for a long time here on Reddit.

He shared with me this [link](https://www.predictany.com/tournament/). where he said he's already participating and that this one is giving prizes to the winners. Has anyone here already joined in this? How was the experience?",What do you think about prediction competitions for enhancing trading skills?,2022-07-20
stocks,"Just finished watching the Hulu WeWork documentary, and throughout the entire film, all I could think was ""How is Tesla not just like WeWork??"" The parallels between the two are a lot in my opinion. 

Summarizing real quick and briefly the WeWork documentary:

- Adam shows up in 2010 after the financial crisis. This was a time when people were being a bit greedy, betting on Tech companies a lot of money in hopes of incredible returns or finding that next ""unicorn"". 
- Adam uses his charisma to ensnare people into working for him and investing in his dream, a ""revolution in the workplace"" that would ""forever change the human interaction"" when it comes to business and maybe even societal expectations about work / life balance. Telling people that everyone is a ""creator"" and all this other spiritual stuff. 
- WeWork had a fairly straightforward business model. The company would sign long-term leases on office space (from Adam after he purchased the buildings himself) subdivide it into smaller work areas, and then rent those out to freelancers or small businesses on a short-term basis. 
- The innovation here was the different way of presenting work space to people - changing the overall aesthetic. That is it!! 
- WeWork uses all types of tactics (gets attractive young people, booze, free snacks in offices, the inspirational mantras, etc...) to entice people to work for them or open their offices in WeWork locations, or invest in the company. Adam essentially creates a cult of personality around him, being all about ‚Äúbringing people together‚Äù in the ‚Äúspirit of We."" He cashed in the fact that many people are looking for ""purpose"" in life. 
- Adam Neumann insisted that WeWork was going to be huge, and it had something to do with technology. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre definitely not a real-estate company,‚Äù he said to a skeptical television interviewer. ‚ÄúWe are a community of creators‚Äù who ‚Äúleverage technology to connect people. . . . And it‚Äôs a new way of working. Just like Uber is the sharing economy for cars, and Citibike for bicycles, we‚Äôre the sharing economy for space.‚Äù 
- With momentum on his side, Adam / WeWork expand at crazy levels and get crazy a valuation after investments from SoftBank.
- WeWork is bleeding money like crazy throughout the entire time, and the more they grow, the more cash they burn - who knew paying building mortages or leases would be so expensive when only half of the office space is being used?  Meanwhile, Adam and his wife keep pushing the cult of personality, now telling people that WeWork and the We Company will solve world hunger, education issues, and all these crazy things. 
- WeWork is in debt, and with SoftBank finally stopping all investments on the company, Adam Neuman is finally forced to try to take the company public in order to get more cash. The S1 goes terribly and they are forced to shelf the IPO due to the market's reaction - valuation dropped tremendously as investor lost confidence in the company. 


With all this in mind, I cannot see Tesla as anything else but a WeWork waiting to happen...

- Musk is another CEO who uses charisma in order to push the company to where he wants. Is he smarter than Adam, yes I would say in general he is smarter. However, Elon has been more and more in the media for negative reasons than good ones... The cult of personality around Elon has begun to erode finally and more people are starting to see him in a negative way. 
- Tesla keeps saying that they are a Tech company, not a Car Manufacturer. However, at the end of the day, that is what they are, a car manufacturer. They sell cars.... 
- Tesla keeps pushing the tech on their cars as a reason for why it should be though of as a Tech company, but car manufacturer companies like Ford, BMW, Chrysler, and other are already catching up in terms of the 'self-driving' capabilities and battery technology for electric cars. It would be like me calling Ford a Tech company now that they have the Mach E and the electric Ford F150... just not the case. 
- Tesla delivers less cars than any of the other car manufacturers, WAY LESS CARS... but somehow their valuation is higher than the top ten car manufacturers combined! How in the world???!?!?
- Tesla is getting sued by the government due to Musk misleading the public and investors about his AutoPilot technology - which doesn't exist yet really. 


In general, I see Tesla as the next WeWork. Tesla‚Äôs stock price is completely divorced from any kind of financial reality. If you look at the history of Tesla‚Äôs stock price, it was never based on car sales. It‚Äôs always been based on hype from Musk and a vision for a future. That vision was appealing to many, but as Musk's eccentricity keeps growing... I don't see this lasting a lot longer.

stocks,"It's not hard to scroll past many comments over the months on the subreddit from a ton of different people that list out a ton of different reasons as to why the market *SHOULD* (based on XYZ logic and XYZ reasoning) fall further (in their opinion).

Lots of people don't see enough value in SPX 3800 to deploy their sideline cash and are waiting for lower levels. Some people call ""perma-bull dip buyers"" stupid. Some people claim to be short since SPX 4700.

People who are obsessed with seeing this bear market play out to the tune of 3600, 3400, 3200, 3000 and refuse to deploy their cash into equities until then... you sound like the majority sometimes but... are you actually the minority? Why is the market glued to 3800 like a magnet? If everybody held your same belief, wouldn't nobody be buying right now?

We hit 3719 on 2022-07-14 and have basically bounced 4-5% off of it since then

We hit 3666 on 2022-06-16 and have basically bounced 6%+ off of it since then

If we can assume that the price of SPX is going up because there's buyer side demand driving the price up over and over again... at what point will the ""it needs to go below 3600 for ________ reasons"" admit to themselves they aren't special, they don't have any knowledge/information that isn't publicly generally available, and their stubbornness is costing them money at this point?

Everybody wants to look smart and cool and be able to say ""I told you say, wait for capitulation!"" but in the mean time... the market is showing extreme reluctance to anything below 3800 for any extended period of time

I personally don't care. I don't have any kind of short position and I am dollar cost averaging like the rest of the boring investors. It just seems funny to me that people with a $5k investment portfolio or a $20k net worth think they are going to beat Wall Street with patience.","Is there any logic behind ""if everybody wants SPX 3600 and below, it won't happen?""",2022-07-19

stocks,"Tesla Inc. is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday after the bell, with Wall Street worried it will be a ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù quarter for the electric-vehicle maker amid ongoing supply-chain snags and pandemic-related factory shutdowns. ‚ÄúWe fully expect a difficult (second quarter), based on continuing supply-chain issues and factory shutdowns,‚Äù said Bill Selesky, an analyst with Argus Research.

Tesla TSLA, 0.55% earlier this month reported a quarter-on-quarter fall in deliveries, its proxy for sales, leading some analysts to cut their expectations for the EV maker‚Äôs quarter. But some of the issues facing Tesla are already accounted for in Wall Street estimates, and investors are aware, Selesky said. He said he expects Tesla to ‚Äúmodestly‚Äù beat expectations thanks to reduced costs and relatively strong margins.

Dan Levy at Credit Suisse said the ‚Äúkey question‚Äù for investors next week will be ‚Äúthe magnitude of margin pressure from the Shanghai shutdown‚Äù due to China‚Äôs ‚ÄúCOVID zero‚Äù policies. Levy said he expects margin recovery in the second half of the year as ‚ÄúTesla ramps on volume.‚Äù

**Here‚Äôs what to expect:**

**Earnings:** Analysts polled by FactSet expect Tesla to report adjusted earnings of $1.82 a share in the second quarter, which would compare with adjusted earnings of $1.45 a share in the second quarter of 2021. Estimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts as well as buy-side analysts, fund managers, company executives, academics and others, is expecting an adjusted profit of $2.05 a share for Tesla.

**Revenue:** The analysts surveyed by FactSet are calling for sales of $16.54 billion for Tesla, which would compare with $12 billion in the second quarter of 2021. Estimize is expecting $17.1 billion in revenue for the quarter.

stocks,"As per this recent Bloomberg article: ""Senate Democrats are urging the White House to declare a ‚Äúclimate emergency‚Äù while dismissing any optimism that a climate change package could be moved swiftly through Congress in September. ‚ÄúThe potential to enact the legislation is dead,‚Äù Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, told reporters on Capitol Hill Monday evening. ‚ÄúThis then frees up the president to use the full powers of the executive branch. And those full powers certainly include a climate emergency.‚Äù

The article continues by stating that "" Such a move could give President Joe Biden broad executive authority to redirect funds for clean energy projects or restrict offshore oil drilling. The president could even use the power to curtail the movement of fossil fuels on pipelines, trains and ships.""

This will have some major implications for the energy spectrum across the board. Given that energy prices are already very high, these measures would just make the problem worse. If this happens though, which I hope it doesn‚Äôt for the sake of energy security in the US, it could see a lot of capital move towards the nuclear power and solar/wind industries. Focusing on nuclear power in particular, it's important to note that this administration is pro-nuclear power and that the sector has bipartisan support in the US. Any measure that will open the floodgates for more investment in green energy simply has to include nuclear power as a substantial part of that, there is simply no other way around it and recent policy decisions in the US, Japan and Europe have shown this as well.

On the other side of the proverbial coin, halting new investments in fossil fuel projects and trying to put a stranglehold on this critical part of the energy spectrum will only push prices up. With demand nowhere near topping out, attempting to demolish the supply side with measures like the one described above will have big adverse effects and make the energy crisis we find ourselves in even worse. Whether or not the US actually goes through with this remains to be seen, as nothing is ever set in stone when it comes to making policy, but my view is that it will push up prices across the energy space for the reasons mentioned above.

With that in mind, I believe that when monetary policy changes and a renewed risk-on  environment is established, we will see some big moves up for energy and see that part of the market continue to outperform as it has done at the start of this year. My personal focus is on oil and uranium as asset classes in this energy bull market.

stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- China is expected to fine Didi Global Inc. more than $1 billion before wrapping up a year-long probe into the ride-hailing giant, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the issue as saying.

Beijing will then allow the Chinese company to restore its main apps to mobile stores and again add new users to its platform, the Journal said. Didi can also work toward a listing in Hong Kong, it said.

Representatives for the Cyberspace Administration of China and Didi didn‚Äôt reply to the Journal‚Äôs requests for comment.

Didi is one of the companies at the heart of a bruising clampdown on the internet industry that Beijing initiated in 2020. Investors have been awaiting the penalties for Didi since the CAC launched a probe in 2021 into potential violations of data security.¬†

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

stocks,"  Two months before Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine, on December 17 2021, V. Putin signed a decree on preparing the entire Russian economy for work in military conditions. However, Moscow did not expect a high consolidation of Western states and strong sanctions in response to unprovoked aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. In this regard, the State Duma (lower house of the Russian parliament) and the RF government during recent months were forced to make a number of amendments to the current legislation to speed up and strengthen the process of full subordination economic and social life of the state for war purposes.

On July 14, V. Putin signed a new law on special economic measures, which, de facto, consolidated the total militarization of the Russian economy. The law allows to involve employees of certain organizations (primarily, military-industrial complex) to work overtime, at night, in weekends and holidays, and also changes the procedure for granting vacations. The Law also makes it possible to forcibly involve various companies to fulfill the state order for the needs of the RF Armed Forces. In addition, the leadership of the Russian Federation received the right to reopen mobilization capacities and facilities and cancel reservation of state reserve material assets. That is, the Russian Federation is openly preparing for a long war with Ukraine and is not afraid to use the format of a war of attrition.

At the same time, Moscow hopes not only to sign a peace treaty, ‚Äúsave face‚Äù, and triumphantly win the war against Ukraine and the entire anti-Putin coalitions of Western countries and their allies. With this aim, the Kremlin ordered to concentrate all efforts in certain sectors of the economy, namely, rocket and space industries and the military-industrial complex. As for the population of the Russian Federation, the country's leadership will do everything from his best so that no one dies of hunger. However, such categories as GDP per capita, decent health care, high level of solvency, indicators of people's prosperity and state of the environment in the Russian Federation don't take into account (at least until victory over the liberal West).

Due to the fact that the Roskosmos enterprises and the military-industrial complex have been working for the last 30 years in cooperation with Western countries, the share of imported raw materials, composite materials, electronics, engines, components and parts that used in Russia, is just unreal! The top leadership of the Russian Federation understands that it is impossible to organize import substitution of all this quickly and effectively. Therefore, the Kremlin decided to concentrate all efforts and resources in a relatively narrow area - provision and modernization of the Russian Aerospace Forces. Programs of peaceful development of space will be collapsed.

Military-industrial complex enterprises working for the ground forces, navy and aviation (except for strategic bombers) become less of a priority. In Moscow, they understand that they will fail to meet the competition with NATO member countries on land, at sea or in air combat.

Powerful strikes from the air and space is the last trump card with which the Russian Federation can still blackmail the world. We are talking about hypersonic high-precision weapons, nuclear tactical charges, intercontinental ballistic rockets and new developments related to space rockets. V. Putin has appointed new leaders to strengthen this sphere of defence (and, more precisely, threats and blackmail). Thus, Yuri Borisov (in 2018-2022, supervisor of the military - industrial complex in the government) was appointed as head of Roscosmos state corporation, and Denis Manturov, Minister of Industry and Trade, was increased to the level of Deputy Prime Minister with focus on the militarization of the Russian economy.

In addition, the youngest daughter of President V. Putin, Ekaterina Tikhonova, has become the co-chair of the coordinating council on import substitution at the RSPP (Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs)*.* Although her first official position in the power system sounds very modest and covertly. According to confidential information, her main duty was monitoring the process of import substitution only in the rocket and space industry.

Thus, the latest actions of the authoritarian Russian state clearly show that it is not going to reach a peace settlement with Ukraine or with Democratic West as a whole. V. Putin is firmly and confidently adheres to the policy that he began to implement in 2014, it is the forcible seizure of Ukraine and cynical intimidation of the rest of the world with its missiles.",From the Militarization of the Economy to Threats from Outer Space,2022-07-19

‚ÄúWhile sales have continued to grow at an unprecedented rate, so have the costs of our business, particularly in light of the macroeconomic climate and global supply chain challenges,‚Äù a company spokesperson said in a statement shared with SFGATE. ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt an easy decision, but it was the responsible one, as it will allow us to honor our commitment to best serve our members as a healthy business for years to come while growing at a more sustainable rate.‚Äù

The company's main product is a wall-mounted, 24-inch touch screen with digital weights and a suite of workouts. With [celebrity endorsements and financial backing](https://www.tonal.com/blog/from-our-ceo-tonal-announces-110-million-in-new-funding/)¬†from Klay Thompson, Steph Curry and Serena Williams¬†‚Äî the company has snagged some serious athletic bona fides.

Employees will receive at least eight weeks of severance pay, company health care benefits through September and payments for COBRA through the end of the year, the spokesperson said. The company is also ‚Äúoffering extended equity vesting‚Äù for all employees, granting them the opportunity to become shareholders.",San Francisco-based Peloton rival Tonal lays off more than a third of its workforce,2022-07-19

stocks,"Basically my theory is that stock splits may be an indicator of a market decline. Or market sentiment about a market decline.

GME, GOOGL, TSLA, AMZN, SHOP being examples of companies that have or will likely split this year. Because realistically the optics are worse if a stock like GOOGL were to fall from $3000 to $1500 in a downturn than if the stock were to drop from $150 to $75 in a downturn following a split.

Tesla felt overpriced at $1,200 and so by splitting, the sting of a potential market downturn is taken away or certainly mitigated to a degree. In these scenarios you can claim there was a split rather than your stock cratered from $1,000+ and the impact *feels* lighter.

And so someone much smarter than me could probably get the data points together and I believe make a good case for a correlation between a high number of stock splits in a given year and the performance of the market overall in the following year. What do you think?

*****

# [Dow futures jump more than 200 points to start week as Goldman earnings top expectations](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures rose sharply Monday as Goldman Sachs kicked off a busy week of earnings on Wall Street with a report that topped expectations.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 286 points, or 0.92%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.84%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.99%.
*****
&gt; Those moves come as investors anticipate a slew of major earnings this week. Shares of Goldman Sachs popped 3% in the premarket after the investment bank reported an earnings beat on the top and bottom lines. The firm‚Äôs fixed income traders generated about $700 million more revenue than expected.
*****
&gt; Bank of America reported quarterly revenue that beat analyst expectations, though the stock was down slightly in the premarket. JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley kicked off the season for big banks last week, posting mixed quarterly results.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe anticipate volatility to remain elevated as the market toggles between pricing recession risk and soft landing probabilities with each piece of data,‚Äù Citi‚Äôs Scott Chronert said in a recent note.
*****
&gt; IBM will post results after the closing bell.
*****
&gt; Other major earnings on the docket this week include Johnson &amp; Johnson, Netflix, Lockheed Martin, Tesla, United Airlines, Union Pacific, Verizon and a host of other companies.
*****
&gt; Despite the growing recession fears, S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to post a 4.2% increase in second-quarter profit, according to consensus analyst estimates gathered by FactSet. S&amp;P 500 members are also expected to post a 10.2% increase in revenue for the period, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Profit expectations for the full year are still high with S&amp;P 500 companies estimated to post a 9.9% earnings increase for 2022, estimates collected by FactSet show.
*****
&gt; Futures on Monday also got a boost after Boeing shares gained more than 3% on news that Delta Air Lines was buying 100 737 Max 10 planes.
*****
&gt; The major averages are coming off a losing week, despite a Friday relief rally that saw the Dow jump more than 650 points. The 30-stock benchmark shed 0.16% on the week. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.93% and 1.57%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Friday‚Äôs relief rally came as traders bet that the Federal Reserve will be less aggressive than feared at its upcoming meeting. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that the central bank is on track to lift interest rates by 75 basis points at its meeting later this month. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius also said in an overnight note that he expected the Fed to raise rates by 0.75 percentage point.
*****
&gt; Still, it was the second negative week in the last three for all the major averages. Recession fears have been front and center in recent weeks as market participants worry that aggressive action from the Fed ‚Äî in an effort to tame decades-high inflation ‚Äî will ultimately tip the economy into a recession.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúMarkets are likely to remain volatile in the coming months and trade based on hopes and fears about economic growth and inflation,‚Äù Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a recent note to clients.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúA more durable improvement in market sentiment is unlikely until there is a consistent decline both in headline and in core inflation readings to reassure investors that the threat of entrenched price rises is passing,‚Äù he added.
*****
&gt; A batch of economic data drove last week‚Äôs wild market action. Inflation jumped 9.1% in June, a hotter-than-expected reading and the largest increase since 1981. That, in turn, led traders to bet that the Fed could raise rates by a full percentage point at its meeting at the end of July.
*****
&gt; By the end of the week, however, some of those fears retreated on the back of a strong retail sales number as well as comments from some Fed officials.

I assume the decrease was priced into the stock since it's down 34%from the Novenber highs.  To me though,  a company's value is in a rising operations trend, not a saw tooth pattern of ups and downs.
